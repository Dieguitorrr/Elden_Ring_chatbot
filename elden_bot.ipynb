      "[Doc 1: The Beginner's Guide to Elden Ring]\n",
      "When you play through Elden Ring, you'll inevitably run up against bosses or areas that will humble you. In these moments, it's important to remember that these obstacles are often there by design. They do not block the path, they are the path. Through skill, or creativity, or just by coming back later, you can overcome any obstacle in this game, and this video will give you all the tools you need to do so. Before you do anything else, you should try to master the basics of combat. At the core of combat is your stamina bar. This resource is depleted when you perform the actions necessary for fighting. For example, sprinting, dodging, blocking attacks, attacking, all of these things, and more, require stamina. Next, let's talk about the proper flow of combat. While locked on with R3, keep your shield raised with L1. This will prevent damage from any attacks that are too fast for you to react to. As you block them, your stamina bar will be depleted, so make sure to drop your shield in between attacks in order to regain that stamina faster. Now, blocking fast attacks often doesn't deplete too much of your stamina, but blocking slow attacks is often a different story, and a lot of them can easily break your guard, leaving you wide open. Thus, if you think you can anticipate a slow attack or a series of attacks, it's often better to roll through them instead. Rolls have invincibility frames that nullify all damage if you press the roll button around the instant where you would have been hit. And while this is more difficult to do than blocking, avoiding damage in this way is way more stamina efficient than just blocking. Oh, and make sure that you stay below 70% equipment load as well, so that your rolls stay fast and effective. As you fight an enemy, pay special attention to their animations and try to memorize their moveset. Over time, you will learn the best way to avoid certain attacks and where their openings lie. So learn to fight with a mixture of both blocks and rolls. As a general rule, you should block fast attacks and roll through slow attacks. By fighting efficiently in this way, you'll avoid damage, and still have stamina left over to deal damage while the boss or enemy is left open. A new way to deal damage in Elden Ring is with guard counters, which are a core part of Elden Ring's combat and essentially allow you to weaponize your own defense. So shortly after successfully blocking an attack, you can retaliate by tapping R2 and performing a guard counter attack. These counters are extremely powerful. If you recognize an opportunity to safely perform one, you should. They deal great damage, and many lesser enemies will immediately have their super armor broken, opening them up for a critical attack with R1. But what is super armor? Well, it's an invisible meter that enemies and bosses have. It depletes when they take damage, and when you fully deplete this meter and break their super armor, you can perform a critical attack by tapping R1. As a rule of thumb, any R2 attack will do more super armor damage. Jumping R2 attacks do a lot, running R2 attacks are great too, but fully charged R2 attacks seem to do the most. Also worth noting is that super armor regenerates over time. Therefore, it's important that you continually deal damage to your enemies. If you sense a boss is close to breaking point, go on the offensive with your R2 attacks. Try to do a lot of super armor damage in a short period of time. Often, you'll be rewarded. On the other hand, if you're just looking to do consistent damage, well, tapping R1 is probably the way to go. R1 attacks generally come out much faster. They combo longer, and they're not as risky to perform. And if you really want to prioritize damage over defense, then you can two-hand your weapon. The input for this is to hold triangle or Y, and tap R1 or L1 to two-hand your right-hand item or left-hand item, respectively. In addition to granting you a new moveset, you will have more strength, more damage, more super armor damage, and you can often avoid recoil when striking an enemy's shield. So if your shield just isn't helping much with an encounter, consider two-handing for damage instead. Now, while you two-hand, you'll mostly be dodging for defense in this state. That said, it's worth noting that you can still block while two-handing, and while you'll take some chip damage because a weapon isn't as good as a shield is for blocking, it's still a good idea to block in many situations, or at least to keep your guard up, especially if you want to utilize guard counters. Another offensive alternative to two-handing is power stancing, which can be achieved by equipping two weapons of the same class, one in each hand. With this, you'll get access to a special L1 attack that utilizes both weapons. Just like your R1 attacks, your L1 attacks do a combo of strikes, and can be utilized in jumping attacks as well. Speaking of jumping attacks, they're incredible gap closers, allowing you to cover distance and queue an attack simultaneously. If an enemy is left open, but you're kind of far away, just close the distance with a jumping attack and see how effective they can be. Jumping R1 attacks are generally better for flying or mounted enemies, and jumping R2 attacks are generally better if you want to inflict damage and posture damage upon grounded enemies. Damage can be healed with your Flask of Crimson Tears, which will always replenish when you warp or sit at a Grace Checkpoint. Additionally, you can get extra Flask charges by clearing out a group of enemies, or by defeating these small red creatures. At Grace Checkpoints, you can upgrade your Flask with Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears. Golden Seeds are found at minor Erd trees, and increase the amount of Flasks you can carry. Sacred Tears are found at Churches of Marika, and increase the amount healed by your Flasks. Furthermore, you can balance the allotment of Crimson Flasks versus Cerulean Flasks at a point of Grace, to better suit your needs. To quickly access your Crimson Healing Flask at any time, consider making it the first item on your Quick Select bar. This way, if you hold down on the D-pad, you'll always shortcut to it instantly. At the top of the D-pad, you'll be able to cycle through your current selection of spells. New spells can be memorized at a site of Grace. These spells will either be incantations, which must be cast with an equipped seal, or sorceries, which must be cast with an equipped staff. Cycle through your equipped armaments by pressing left or right on the D-pad. If you die, then you'll drop all of your runes at your point of death. If you don't pick them up during your next life, then they'll be gone forever. Make sure to seek them out using your compass whenever you can, or invest them in items or your own character. When you do die, you can choose to resurrect at a site of Grace, or sometimes at a Stake of Marika. If you see this statue, or this icon, then it's probably an indication that you're in a difficult area, or near a boss, as a Stake of Marika is nearby. Respawning at a Stake of Marika will usually make your run back to your runes less severe, so it's often best to choose that option, unless you'd prefer to move on from what killed you. If you're out in the open world, one way to overcome difficulty is by choosing the right scenarios to fight on your mount. Against large or mounted enemies that struggle against hit-and-run tactics, the mount is definitely the way to go. While mounted, R1 and R2 give you light and heavy attacks on the right side, and L1 and L2 give light and heavy attacks on your left side. If you hold your heavy attack input, then you can charge them up, dealing continuous damage while you charge, which culminates in a strong attack at the end. While mounted, you automatically wield the armament in your right hand. If you would prefer to wield the armament in your left hand, use a two-handing input, so hold triangle or Y, and then tap L1 or R1. Your mount can take damage separately from you, but his damage can be healed by your Crimson Flasks, as well as by craftable Rower Raisins. As you get hit on your mount, you run the risk of losing your own super armor and getting knocked down for an extended period of time. If this happens, you are extremely vulnerable. If you're taking damage, then at a certain point, no matter what you're fighting, it's probably wise to dismount and fight them on foot for a little while. Jumping attacks off your horse are a great way to transition into melee combat. Dismount with L3 and slam them with L1, R1, or R2. The distance you cover with this is absurd, and initiating a fight in this way gives you an immediate advantage. As the fight goes on, consider if mounting up again for a burst of speed would be to your benefit. Against this flying dragon, for example, certain attacks are better off being outpaced on a mount. For a reliable way to mount up quickly, I would recommend binding your Spectral Steed Whistle to your pouch, a secondary d-pad menu that can be edited in the menu screen. You can quickly access all four of these bindings by holding down triangle or Y, then tapping the appropriate d-pad button. This way, you'll have a consistent input for mounting up instead of toggling rapidly through your items looking for your whistle. This same logic applies to any other item you want quick, reliable access to, like weapon buffs or poison cures. In addition to your double jump for extra height, be on the lookout for Spirit Springs, which take you to incredible heights. Conversely, you can safely jump into a Spirit Spring to negate all fall damage. While on your mount, L3 dismounts you, but when on foot, L3 can be used for stealth. In this crouched state, enemy aggro range is reduced, and you'll have an easier time getting R1 backstabs. Enemy aggro range is also reduced at night, so consider passing time at a site of grace to better suit your needs. At night, however, you might also find different enemies spawning in the world, so be aware of that. Another thing to get in the habit of is crafting, which you can do as soon as you buy the crafting kit from Kale at the Church of Ela. After this, the crafting tab in your menu screen will unlock for use. After a few hours of play, you should have accumulated a few recipe books to expand your crafting options, and if you've been hunting and foraging between bosses, then you'll be able to make a lot of great items. Pay attention to what material drops you're finding in the world. It'll make it that tiny bit easier to gather more of it when you realize you need it to craft something specific. The crafting page gives you hints at where to find specific materials, and most world materials respawn instantly upon resting at a grace, making them fairly easy to farm. Oh, and while you're at Kale, grab a torch to help you see in dark caves, and when you find one of Kale's fellow merchants on a beach southwest of the Church of Ela, grab a bow as well. Ranged weapons are excellent utility tools, allowing you to lure, poison, or sleep enemies from afar. There are two types of bow weapons, bows and crossbows, which use arrows or bolts respectively. Enter precision aiming mode with L1 while two-handing the bow, and press R1 to fire the projectile in the first slot, and R2 to fire the projectile in the second slot. So, thinking creatively with craftable items or using utility items like bows, that's a great way to overcome difficulty, but sometimes you might just feel like your damage is too low, and in that situation, you'll have to reinforce your weapon, which can be done at the Church of Ela at the smithing table. Here, you'll be able to get most armaments to plus three with smithing stone shards that are found throughout the world. That said, special armaments require other special shards, and to go beyond plus three, you'll need to find an actual blacksmith. Alternatively, if you aren't happy with your shield, take a look at its stats. The most reliable shields are those that block 100% physical damage, but you can consider switching shields to suit specific encounters. The other stat you'll want to look at is guard boost. Higher guard boost means you'll take less of a stamina hit when you block. Upgrading an armament is a bit of a commitment. You can always find more smithing stone shards in caves and around the world, but these are fairly rare, so make sure you really enjoy swinging a weapon before you upgrade it. Of course, a weapon also has to suit your build. Your build is determined by what stats you decide to level at a grace checkpoint when you summon Melana and invest your runes with her. When you start the game, you'll have to choose a starting character. Some use magic, some have ranged weapons, and some excel in melee, but it's important to remember that your starting class does not dictate your build. You do. While each character's starting stats give them different strengths and weaknesses, you are free to build your character in any direction from this point. If you haven't settled on a build yet, then you can't go too wrong by just leveling vigor for HP and resistance, endurance for stamina and equipment load, or mind to increase your focus points. But it's the other stats that make a real impact on your character archetype. Strength, for example, mostly affects your ability to wield heavy armaments, as well as your defense. Strength weapons are often slow, so being a lot more tanky will come in handy. Another stat to look out for is poise, which will raise as you put on heavier armor, and having high poise will often prevent you getting interrupted mid-attack, which is really good for slow weapons. Dexterity is the counterpart to strength, and it raises your ability to wield a lot of lighter armaments, boosting their attack power. It also softens fall damage, makes it harder for you to be knocked off your horse, and reduces the casting time of spells. Spells usually scale in damage with intelligence or faith. Intelligence generally boosts the damage of sorceries, while faith generally boosts the damage and healing of incantations. Arcane is also a new attribute in Elden Ring, and it governs your discovery stat, which increases enemy item drop rates. It's also a stat that increases the damage of certain sorceries and incantations, and can play into the stat scaling of certain weapons as well. Every weapon comes with a default scaling, and your favorite weapon will really influence which build you end up going with. However, one thing you can do is apply an Ash of War to your weapon, which allows you to choose a more beneficial damage type, and more beneficial scaling options for that weapon. Beyond their scaling options though, Ashes of War can be used to apply skills to your armaments. Once applied, L2 will unleash their effects, and you can always see which skill you will perform with L2 here. To apply an Ash of War, be sure to pick up the Whetstone Knife in a cellar at the Gatefront Ruins. After this, sit at a Grace Checkpoint, and experiment with your options. Often, these skills will default to your shield's applied Ash of War, unless you two-hand your weapon, or use a shield without a special skill. These attacks are very powerful, and even require a small amount of focus points to use. Your FP is represented here, in this blue bar. This is a really valuable resource, especially for magic builds which also rely on it to cast spells. That said, all builds can, and should, find a use for FP. And if you're having trouble in Elden Ring, you should always be thinking of an effective way to make use of this resource. Another powerful way to make use of FP is by summoning spirits. Once you acquire the Summoning Bell early in the game, you'll be able to equip spirits on your quick-select bar, and summon them for difficult encounters. As long as you have enough FP, and as long as this Rebirth Monument symbol marks the encounter as difficult, then your spirits will fight alongside you until death. Some are ranged attackers, some are tanky, and some are a combination of both. Decide what works best for your build, and what works best for the encounter as well. Only one type of spirit can be summoned at a time, and spirits cannot be summoned during multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, if you're having trouble, be on the lookout for Feral Calling Finger Remedies, which you can find throughout the world. Once consumed, these allow you to see other players' summon signs, and summon help for major encounters. That said, you'll always be able to see NPC summon signs, so feel free to make good use of them. Alternatively, other players' signs can be accessed in summoning pools, located at summoning effigies that are placed in key areas. If you want to learn more about engaging in multiplayer, read the items on your multiplayer tab in the menu screen. In general, if there's a tip that you want to read again that popped up, you can find all of those in your inventory menu all the way at the end. Last, but not least, is your map. Revealing the map for an area will make it way easier to progress through the game. Map fragments can be collected at these glowing guide steles. If you're having trouble finding one in an unfamiliar area, try to stick to the main path, or, failing that, try to look for this shape on your undiscovered map. With the map open, you can mark points of interest with markers or beacons that show up in the overworld. You can also fast travel between sites of lost grace, or get a clearer idea of the direction that the main story requires. Rays of light will guide you on that path, and often lead you towards your next logical checkpoint. Of course, it's up to you if you want to trust... the guidance of grace. If you're having trouble with the main path, just go in the opposite direction. Explore, get stronger, learn how to master your build. The guidance of grace can often be spurned to great effect. Thank you for listening.\n",

      "[Doc 2: 10 Essential Early-Game Discoveries in Elden Ring]\n",
      "Some of the most important discoveries in Elden Ring's early game are surprisingly easy to miss. For example, one of the most valuable consumables in Elden Ring is the Flask of Wondrous Physic, which has its single charge replenished every time you rest at a grace checkpoint. That alone should earn it an esteemed place on your quick select bar, as it's the sort of thing you should try to consume for every major encounter. You can find your flask at the Third Church of Marika, located here. But what does it do? Well, that's up to you. By mixing in different crystal tier combinations at a grace checkpoint, you can alter its effects. For example, here, my Crimson Burst tier heals me over time, and my Opaline Bubble tier gives me a shield that protects me from the next attack I'll be hit by. You can get both of these tiers from the Field Boss, fought here. Another essential item is the Whetstone Knife, which allows you to apply Ashes of War to your armaments. You can find the Whetstone Knife here, in a cellar underneath the Gateside Ruins. It's kind of crazy they hid such an important item here, but with this, you can now apply Ashes of War to your weapons, and that allows you to give them new skills and new scaling options to better suit your build. If you want to quickly get a lot of Ashes of War, make sure to visit Banal during the day here, at the Warmaster's Shack. He sells an Ash of War that is perfect for you. No skill. I'm being serious though, because it's actually pretty good. What you do with this one, is you apply it to a shield that has something like a parry, or another skill that you don't like, and by applying this to your shield, it allows your Ash of War to default to your weapons weapon art, rather than your shields. And if you find yourself wielding two weapons, then you might want to duplicate an Ash of War for both of them. To do this, you'll have to trade an item called Lost Ashes of War at the blacksmith, and you're going to want to talk to the blacksmith pretty early, since the smithing table at the Church of Ella can only get your weapons to plus three. But the blacksmith can take them well beyond that. To talk to him though, we'll have to be invited to the round table hold. It's hard to know exactly what triggers Melina to invite you here. I know you definitely get taken there if you defeat Margit at Stormvale Castle, but failing that, you will simply get invited just after exploring the world for a little while, and you can warp here at any time in the bottom left of your map. Defeating Margit is actually also important because he gives you your first talisman pouch. With each pouch you collect, you gain another talisman slot. Talismans are like rings from previous games. You only start with one slot, but in the end, you can have multiple, and they offer diverse and powerful benefits to your character. Just like talismans, your spell memorization slots are now also tied to items. So if you want to memorize more than two spells at a time, then you'll need to seek out memory stones. Your first memory stone can be found at Iridescent Rise, where you'll have to solve a simple puzzle in order to gain access and open the chest within. Put this in your new memory slot, the world is a lot more dangerous at night. In addition to night enemies, tons of night bosses also seem to spawn. So if you're looking for more bosses to fight, and you think you might have missed some in the early game, head here, here, here, and here. You'll find some good bosses here. Now, to offset this apparent rise in world difficulty at night, in my experience, your rune acquisition at night is also boosted, and this is thanks to three new mechanics. The first mechanic is this. When the Erd tree graces you with this golden rain of leaves, you've just chanced upon a really rare weather effect that buffs your character. What does this buff do? I'm not sure exactly. The icon here is that of a four-fingered foul foot, which has items that increase item discovery and rune acquisition, so it's likely that this rain does something similar. Now, the official guide says that this rain increases rune acquisition by four to five percent, so I guess that's likely to be correct, although my testing actually revealed nothing of the sort. The only other option I can think of is that it boosts item acquisition. Whatever the case, though, it's probably a good idea to farm some enemies while this buff is active, just based on the icon, if nothing else. The second thing to look out for are enemies with golden eyes. In my experience, these enemies drop four times the amount of runes when you kill them. So if you see an enemy with golden eyes, go out of your way. I love this mechanic. It really encourages you to take up some fights that you might just usually have run past, you know. Last but not least, be on the lookout for glowing white skulls upon the ground. Once broken apart, these will give you a golden rune consumable. They spawn in random locations and can easily be looted by trampling them with torrent and spamming the loot button. Some folks will want to spend these runes on becoming more powerful, but that's lame, honestly. Instead, you should spend them on looking good and getting that Elden Bling. What I'm doing here is called armor alteration, where elements of some sets of armor can be changed for a small price. For example, a cloak can be added to the commoner set, and profits can be freed from the neck piece. Of course, every armor piece is different, so check it out for 500 runes and see what changes. To unlock armor alteration, you have to defeat the boss of the Demihuman Cave in southwestern Limgrave. When you're victorious, you'll receive the tailoring kit and a sewing needle. The tailoring kit unlocks armor alteration, but the sewing needle is actually a part of Bok's questline. Bok's questline can be started in a grove of trees located here, and I suspect his questline might lead towards more armor alteration. Now, when I started this build, I wanted to be a glorious, faithful kind of Valkyrie character. Then, I found a black crossbow, a spell that casts darkness, and an evil-looking flail. These things were way too edgy for me, but luckily, in Elden Ring, you can change your character's appearance to better suit your build, so that's what I did. It's easy to miss, but in Fear's room at Round Table Hold, go up to this mirror. This is the clouded mirror stand. Here, you'll be able to return to the character creation screen and change everything except your starting stats and keepsake, of course. Make sure you frequently do return to the Round Table Hold to see if anything's changed or if any new NPCs have dropped by. Roderica should be one of the first new appearances here. You can talk to Roderica out in the world, here by the Stormhill Shack, but it doesn't seem absolutely necessary for her questline for you to talk to her here. Just progress through the game, and she should eventually show up at Round Table Hold, whether you've talked to her before or not. After you've talked to her in Round Table Hold, go and talk to the blacksmith, and then go back and talk to her again, and you can trigger a progression in her questline. After reloading the area, she will have found her purpose as a spirit tuner, someone who you should return to frequently to upgrade the strength of your favorite phantoms. Of course, if you haven't already, you can get the Spirit Summoning Bell from Renna when you return to the Church of Ela. The resource used for upgrading your spirits is called Glovewort. Regular spirits require Grave Glovewort, and special spirits require Ghost Glovewort. Glovewort is found all throughout the Catacomb dungeons specifically, and unlike other resources, it doesn't appear to respawn after resting at a grace checkpoint, so be sure to loot these dungeons thoroughly. Number nine is one of my favorite new things they've added to the game, bar none. Paintings. After you interact with one, the puzzle has begun. Your job now is to go and find that place depicted in the painting out in the actual world. This painting, for example, asked me to find these gravestones. I remembered seeing them a while ago, so I tracked them down near the Seaside Grace, and was rewarded by the painter. I got a Scarab headpiece that increases my damage taken, but increases the damage my faith spells do. This second painting was way trickier, and it was this one in Stormvale Castle. I'm not going to tell you where it depicts, but I will give you an important clue for all of your paintings going forward. Remember, you don't have to find the place depicted in the painting, you have to find the location it was painted from. If you ever need to review the paintings you're tracking, then you can find them in your inventory menu here, at the top of the screen. A new feature in Elden Ring are group passwords. Unlike multiplayer passwords, which restrict you to only interacting with people using the same password, group passwords simply let you visually distinguish who is using the same password as you, and who isn't. You can still interact with everybody. For example, this sign on the left is using the same group password, and the sign on the right isn't. The same goes for phantoms, and messages, and even bloodstains, and I think it would be really cool to see others from our community while you're playing the game. So I want to make a community group called Secret Seekers. Our community password will be Seekers, all capitalized like that. As a Secret Seeker, it's your job to drop your gold summon sign or a message, and guide others to a secret, whether that's a dungeon or a hidden path nearby. If you're happy with a message, then upvote it, and if you have a good co-op session that leads to finding a new secret, then consider dropping a reward for your fellow Seeker. Remember, our community password is Seekers.

      "[Doc 3: Elden Ring's Lore ► Explained!]\n",
      "Our story doesn't begin in the Lands Between. It begins in the cosmos, far away, with an Outer God called the Greater Will. There are a lot of Outer Gods mentioned in Elden Ring. You can think of these kind of like the Great Ones of Bloodborne, they're distant beings, they're all powerful, and they're quite unknowable by design. But many of these Outer Gods want to make their presence felt in the world. The Greater Will may be most of all. To this end, it sent a golden star hurtling towards the Lands Between. The Elden Star's incantation tells us that this golden star was bearing a beast, an Elden Beast. The Elden Remembrance calls it a Vassal Beast of the Greater Will. If you didn't know, a vassal is someone who holds land on behalf of their overlord. Obviously this is fitting in this case, because the Elden Beast occupied the Lands Between on behalf of the Greater Will, and was a living incarnation of the concept of order. As such, this beast would later become the Elden Ring. The Elden Ring itself is made up of runes of power, some great, some small, that together represent a sort of logic for the world to follow. Thus, the Elden Ring represents order. The true nature of this order is a subject of constant debate and research undergone by fundamentalists. But two of the key fundamentals are the Laws of Causality and Regression. You can think of the Law of Causality as cause and effect, where actions have consequences, and those consequences are new causes that branch out into infinity. These are the relationships between things. Then there's the Law of Regression, that states that all things eternally yearn to converge and return to their roots. Fittingly, then, the Elden Ring is housed within the Erd Tree, which towers over the Lands Between. But it's very important to stress that life in the Lands Between did not begin with the Erd Tree, the Elden Ring, or the Elden Beast. No, the Lands Between were occupied well before the Greater Will came. There were other beings here. There were other factions here. There were other gods here. And there was even another great tree here, before the Erd Tree. And this is where a huge twist regarding the Erd Tree comes in. So there are incantations in the game called Aspects of the Crucible. According to their descriptions, these are manifestations of the Erd Tree's primal vital energies. And I quote, they are an aspect of the primordial crucible where all life was once blended together. But how could all life be blended together in the Erd Tree if the Erd Tree appeared after life existed? Well, there can only be one answer, right? That the Erd Tree is a parasite, and it took over a tree that existed here before. This ancient tree was called the Great Tree. So the Great Tree was almost certainly the location of this primordial crucible, and it must have been a very powerful primordial force for the Greater Will to have commandeered. It might even be the reason the Lands Between is important to the Greater Will in the first place. It also explains why spells and enemies related to the Great Tree's crucible would eventually be looked down upon. For example, the Knot Talisman is fashioned from a knotted vestige of the Crucible, and it was considered a signifier of the divine in ancient times, but is now increasingly disdained as an impurity as civilization has advanced. Enemies related to the Crucible are the Omen, the Misbegotten, and the Crucible Knights, and all three of them would be shunned, enslaved, or imprisoned. Those who speak for the Erd Tree don't want you to know its roots, so to speak. According to the spell, protection of the Erd Tree, in the beginning everything was in opposition to the Erd Tree, but through countless victories in war it became the embodiment of order. In Marika's own words, the Erd Tree governs all. The choice is thine. Become one with the order, or divest thyself of it. To wallow at the fringes, a powerless upstart. But the Greater Will needed more than a big tree, it needed loyal agents in the Lands Between. To this end, it has the Two Fingers, who are its envoys. The Two Fingers' heirloom has a weird picture of them, but it reads, Of course, fingers cannot speak, yet these are eloquent. Persistently they wriggle, spelling out mysteries in the air. Thus did we gain the words, the words of our faith. These words are interpreted by the Finger Readers. These are the undying old crones that you would have found throughout the Lands Between. They pass down the wisdom of the Two Fingers, or at least they used to. Your fingers, please, your fingers, I can't read them. Most of them appear to have lost their purpose, and they're desperate to read your fingers and tell you annoying riddles, since their Two Fingers are likely dead. And yes, of course, there are multiple sets of Two Fingers. You would have found their corpses on the tops of the Divine Towers. Atop these towers, you loot the fingers in order to activate the true power of a Great Rune. Specifically, though, you are giving benediction back to your Great Rune. You're taking a blessing back from the Two Dead Fingers, essentially. This is just one of many blessings that the Two Fingers can bestow, and my point is kind of that the Two Fingers clearly have more than just influence. They have real power on some level. The Greater Will needs these powerful envoys and agents, because while it's obviously incredibly powerful, it does seem limited by a few things. First is space. The Greater Will didn't come to the Lands Between itself, it sent an Elden Beast to do its bidding instead. Second is time. There is a moment later in the game where your pair of Two Fingers go still, because they're forced to commune with the Greater Will for guidance. So the Greater Will needs a physical manifestation of order, it needs envoys to convey its will, but what it also needs is a god. Introducing Marika the Eternal. I have this utterly enormous mind map of Elden Ring's lore, and there's a reason she's at the centre. She's essentially the equivalent of Gwyn from Dark Souls, except unlike Gwyn, Marika didn't just crawl out of the dark and find power. To an extent, it seems like she earned it. We don't know much about her origins, except that she is of the Numen race, which is actually an origin you can choose in the character selection screen. Numen come from outside the Lands Between, and are supposed descendants of denizens of another world, long lived, but seldom born. At some point, Marika was chosen as an Empyrean. What is an Empyrean? Well, an Empyrean is a being chosen by the Fingers, as a candidate for godhood. As an Empyrean, Marika received the aid of a shadow to do her bidding. What is a shadow? Well, it's a wolf, shadowbound to its Empyrean by the two fingers. Lunar Princess Ranni is another example of an Empyrean, with a shadowbound beast. These creatures are the Empyrean's very own shadow. They are completely loyal to their needs, and by definition, incapable of treachery. Marika's shadow was a beast called Malaketh. Every Empyrean uses their shadow in different ways, but Marika's sole need of her shadow was as a vessel to lock away destined death. So what is destined death? Well, according to Enya, it's the Rune of Death. We mentioned earlier that the Elden Ring is made up of runes, and at some point, maybe when she was chosen as a god, Marika plucked the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring. She gave the Rune of Death to Malaketh, her totally loyal shadow, who bore a black blade imbued with this rune. It's kind of genius, really. In a single act, she removed the concept of death from the lands between, while also commanding total control of death through her shadow, who could deliver it at her whim. Some of you might be asking, if death is removed from the lands between, how come I can kill this dog? First off, shame on you. Second, from a lore point of view, that dog isn't really dead, it's simply in the process of its spirit, or soul, returning to the Urd tree. Catacomb dungeons, for example, are specifically constructed near the roots of the great tree for this reason, so that the Urd tree can reabsorb their ashes back into it. This process replaced the concept of a death that you were destined to have, but this random spirit outside of a catacomb dungeon says it best. As another example of this theory, when you kill a major boss, you receive a remembrance of them. These are spirits, and they are hewn into the Urd tree. In this way, thanks to the Urd tree's grace, their spirits are immortalised, in a sense. This new form of death also explains what's happening when you summon spirits, however, some spirits never return to the Urd tree, and they rise within death, as corpses or skeletons instead. So this was the new order, and it's important to stress that it was in this moment, when the Rune of Death was removed, when Destined Death was taken, this is when Order became the Golden Order. Specifically this was Marika's Golden Order. So not only did she become a god and a vessel for the Elden Ring, she became renowned as Marika the Eternal, for her removal of Destined Death. However, Marika had more than just death to conquer, she had wars to fight, as the world was occupied by many forces that could threaten her Golden Order. There was war with the Stormlord, who likely ruled over Stormvale. There was a war with the Giants, who were masters of a flame that could burn the Urd tree. There was war with the Ancient Dragons, who incidentally had stones that could twist time, and thus slay a god. And finally, there was war brewing with the Carian Royalty, who had previously obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order. Thus, similar to how the Greater Will needed an Empyrean to enforce its will, Marika herself needed someone to wage war. So there was to be a husband, a consort, an Elden Lord. The man chosen was Hora Lu, a ferocious warrior who became known as the Lord of the Battlefield. His crown was warranted with strength, and while it was for this strength that Marika married him, he was also required to take a vow to conduct himself as a lord. To suppress the ceaseless lust for battle that raged within, Hora Lu took the beast Regent Saurosh upon his back. You'll notice this is another example of a beast being given for the purpose of serving order. Thus, in this moment, he went from being Hora Lu, warrior, to Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, consort to Queen Marika, and a certified demigod. Godfrey and Marika had three demigod children together. There was Godwin the Golden, who you saw being killed in the opening trailer, and there were also the reviled Omen Twins, Morgoth, who guards the Erd Tree, and Moog, who became Lord of Blood. You might think that Godric was another demigod child, but he actually wasn't. Instead, he was probably descended from Godwin. Anyway, we'll talk about the demigods more in detail in another video, so subscribe for that. But for now, just know that Godfrey and his offspring were the first demigods, henceforth known as the Golden Lineage. In his wars, Godfrey led his sixteen Crucible Knights into battle, who were named so for they fought with the primordial powers of the Erd Tree. Their incantations were aspects of the Crucible itself, and they likely fought giants, dragons, the Storm Lord, and more, to usher in their age, the Age of the Erd Tree. The Erd Tree would go on to be largely seen as a blessing for all those in the Lands Between, especially those close to it in Leyndell, the capital city of the Erd Tree. The tree bestowed blessings, for example, the dew that dropped from its branches were like jewels. It loomed overhead as a constant reminder of order, and its roots reached far and wide, relieving many of the burden of death. In fact, Erd Tree burial was one of the highest honors a hero could receive. One by one, the previous factions of the world fell. The giants were put to the sword, and their fel god was killed by Marika herself. The ancient dragons broke down the walls of Leyndell, but met fierce retaliation. However, I think the House of the Erd Tree encountered the most trouble against the land to their southwest, Leonia. Here, the House of the Moon repelled their offensives time and time again, and I mean that literally, because there was not just one, but two wars fought here, and in both of these, there was no victory for the Golden, nor for the Moon. But I suspect it was probably because of these lobsters. These damn things can snipe you from like a mile away, and it's bullsh- Actually, it was probably because of the Carrier Knights, who according to their weapons were able to wield sorcerous battle skills, and despite numbering fewer than 20, this power made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle. These enchanted knights were anointed by the Lunar Queen, a young astrologer who went on to establish the House of Caria as royalty in this land. With her bewitching lunar magic, she won over the Academy of Ryalucaria, where glintstone sorcery was studied, and united the Carian royal family, and the learned scholars of Ryalucaria defended their home from the Golden aggressors. At the head of this great golden army was Radagon. Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks. He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle. These two champions clashed, fell in love, and joined their houses. Radagon once cleansed himself with Celestial Dew, repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala. The Order of the Erd Tree and the Fate of the Moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven. You might think it's strange that the Greater Will would permit this union, but it's not too odd, all things considered. As with most FromSoftware games, sorcery and faith are just two sides of the same coin, and both of these powers stem from the cosmos. Radagon and Rennala were known to have three children together. Lunar Princess Ranni, who inherited her mother's propensity for lunar magic, Radan, who took after his father Radagon and would go on to master gravitational magic, and Rykard, who pioneered new hex sorceries and would go on to feed himself to a great serpent. It follows that at some point after this, Marika began to harbour doubts. Doubts about the Golden Order, that she had had a hand in creating. In Marika's own words, I declare mine intent to search the depths of the Golden Order through understanding of the proper way. Our faith, our grace is increased. Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. My comrade, why must ye falter? And it's at this point that we should talk about Marika's motivations, her character. This is surely going to be one of those huge points of debate in the coming years, but for now, my working theory is that she wanted to discover the truth behind order and the truth behind the greater will, and she believed that bonds had to be broken so that they could be better understood. She believed that there was great meaning to be found. found in hardship. Queen Marika has high hopes for us. That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity. For Lord Godfrey, his struggle ended at the end of his campaigns. According to his armour, he led the war against the giants, faced the Storm Lord alone. And then, there came a moment, when his last worthy enemy fell. And it was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded. In truth, he was robbed of his grace. Then, Marika sent him away. My lord, and thy warriors, I divest each of thee of thy grace. With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the lands between. Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live and die. This became known as the Long March of the Tarnished, as Godfrey and his tarnished descendants walked away from the lands between. But, Queen Marika absolutely had a plan here. That Lord Godfrey and his descendants would one day return stronger, having struggled outside of grace. Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. Return to the lands between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord, Lord Godfrey. Soon after, she found a new husband. Either that, or a new husband was found for her. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the lands between, Radagon left Rennala to return to the Eartree capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and king consort, taking the title of Second Elden Lord. The mystery endures to this day as to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside, and moreover why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord. Whatever the case, as a part of this union, Radagon's prior three children with Rennala became demigod stepchildren, granted grace thanks to their new family tree. Rennala was broken by this, and so was her country, Leonia. The queen's set reads, when Rennala, head of both the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian royal family lost her husband Radagon, her heart went along with him. And then, those at the Academy realized that Rennala was no champion after all. In the wake of Radagon's betrayal, and Rennala's poor judgment, Leonia struggled with civil war, with the Academy of Raya Lucaria on one side, and the Carian royals on the other. And it's here, during the Age of the Eartree, that Luna Princess Ranni, daughter of Rennala and Radagon, stole a fragment of the Rune of Death. It happened during the Golden Age of the Eartree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Malekith, the Black Blade. As mentioned previously, Malekith was Marika's shadow, and he had sealed destined death in a Black Blade. Then, a fragment, only a fragment, of this Rune of Death was stolen. And once this happened, Malekith went a step further in protecting destined death. He bound the blade within his own flesh, such that none might rob death ever again. It was too late, however. This fragment of the Rune of Death was used immediately, that night, to kill a demigod, Marika's own son, Godwin the Gold. That was the first recorded death of a demigod in all history, and it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering. Now, there is a lot of really credible evidence that Marika was behind this plot to have a fragment of the Rune of Death stolen. There's also a ton of evidence that Marika is behind the entirety of your tarnished quest, but we'll talk about that in another video. For now, all you really need to know, in terms of the timeline at least, is this. After the marriage of Marika and Radagon, and after a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen, Marika went on to shatter the Elden Ring, and Radagon attempted to repair it, to no avail. The Elden Ring had been broken into runes, some great, and some small. Of course, the huge twist in Elden Ring is that Radagon is Marika, or depending on what you believe, he became her, for she knew it was going to happen. You can tell when FromSoftware is keeping something a little bit open-ended, and of everything in Elden Ring's lore, this will also go on to be one of the biggest unknowns, as we move forward. For example, the wording, Thou art yet to become me, reinforces that Marika and Radagon were two separate entities before the shattering. However, in contrast, there is also evidence that Radagon was always part of Marika. For example, Enya says that The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. But how can this be, if Radagon married Rennala and had those demigod children? The only way that makes sense is if Radagon was always Marika, and he just went over there to seduce Rennala long ago. I'll present more concrete theories in the future, but on this matter, the most important thing is, what do you think? While you can figure out a ton of Elden Ring's story, not all of it is open to interpretation. Certain things are, and this is one of them. And your interpretation is a big part of what makes this story special. At any rate, the union of Radagon and Marika seems to be a union of two fundamental opposing laws of the Golden Order. We mentioned these laws earlier, actually. There's the Law of Causality, and Marika is an agent of cause and effect. And there's the Law of Regression, as Radagon is a character who aspires to be complete and regress together. So I have a theory that forcing these two beings that represent these concepts together would have corrected Marika's deviance. But even so, she was imprisoned in the Erd Tree for the crime of the Shattering. She remains a god, and a vision's vessel. The conjoined Radagon and Marika even had two demigod children of their own, Michaela and Milenia. These two children were born afflicted. Michaela was cursed with eternal childhood, and Milenia harbored a horrific rot within. Even so, these two children were both chosen as Imperians. They were immensely sacred beings, and eligible to inherit godhood from the Greater Will. Perhaps the Greater Will was just desperate to find a worthy successor. And indeed, in the Shattering War to come, many would try to claim the Shards of the Elden Ring, and they would try to take the throne. Including, of course, the Tarnished, who returned from their long march at long last. Which we'll talk about in the next main lore video. I should probably also mention here, that if you become a patron, you'll see upcoming lore videos early, as that's one of the rewards you get if you pledge to the $3 tier. And if you think my channel really adds a lot of value to the Souls games for you, to the point where you pledge $20, then in this new tier, you'll receive a new mug every 3 months that has a unique design on it, to do with the games by From Software. There are 4 to collect. The first one you'll get is inspired by Dark Souls, then Elden Ring, then Sekiro, and finally Bloodborne. They all have fantastic art that I worked on with an amazing artist named Chu. But anyway, I figured this is the right place to end this video because the information here is gonna be overwhelming. I bet it probably was too overwhelming, you know? It took me ages to commit these names and the relationships they had with other characters to memory, so I hope you guys are doing alright. One thing that helped me a lot was that we designed an enormous mind map with pretty much all of Elden Ring's lore. All of its item descriptions, all of its dialogues, all of the relationships between characters that we can think of. We added all of this together and it helped a ton in learning about the story and visualizing it all. One day, I will make this asset available to you all because I think after doing it, I think this is the quintessential way to piece together the story, and I think giving you guys this asset eventually will make that accessible for people. So I'm really excited about that. I want to thank Absa and Zard for accepting the paid task of helping me put all the raw data into this mind map so that I could better understand everything. I want to thank Parigod for fulfilling all of my footage requests and creating so many cinematic scenes for this video and for you all to enjoy, and I last of all want to thank John Devlin for the incredible thumbnail, and of course thank you for watching. There are some really exciting things ahead and I actually believe this might be the best story that FromSoftware have ever put together. I just think not only are there so many amazing item descriptions but so many of them are impactful. There are so many moments where you piece together the story and have like a eureka moment, and I'm enjoying it so much. But now I'm going to go and play the game a little bit because I've been editing this video for too long. So see you next time. you\n",

      "[Doc 4: Elden Ring's Demigods ► Explained!]\n",
      "The demigods are, each and all, the direct offspring of Queen Marika. There was Godwin, Morgoth, Moog, Redan, Rykard, Ranni, Michaela, and Melania, Blade of Michaela, Melania, Blade of Michaela, Melania, Blade of Michaela, and Melania, not again. All of these demigods had fallen from grace by the time the Shattering occurred. But in this video, I want to mostly talk about the origins of these characters. Who these demigods were before the fall. And some of these demigods fell a long way, indeed. Before he became this unsightly mess, Godwin the Golden was quite the heroic figure. He was born of the promising union between Lord Godfrey and Queen Marika, and he achieved great renown for his bravery in one of their wars, at least. The War of the Ancient Dragons. This war began when Gransax, a great ancient dragon, reigned calamity down upon Leyndell, marking the only time in historical record that Leyndell's walls had fallen. It's not clear why Gransax first attacked, but fortifying themselves against lightning, the Knights of the Erd Tree weathered his assault, and Gransax was defeated. However, this was only the beginning, and a bitter war against the ancient dragons was to follow. During this war, the Erd Tree sentinels had an epiphany, that the only way to truly protect the Erd Tree was to become dragons themselves. And so, despoiling the corpses of their foes, the grotesque sentinels served the Erd Tree, but fought with the claws of the enemy instead. In the end, the ancient dragons were routed once again. In a graveyard of swords by the Stormcaller Church, the end of the war is commemorated. Here, we learn that during battle, Godwin the Golden defeated Fortisax, called the mightiest dragon of them all. However, he did not kill Fortisax. Instead, he befriended him. And it was in this act that the powers of the ancient dragons truly became a part of Leyndell. After all, only those loved by dragons can survive the ordeal of cladding their bodies in lightning. So, from an unlikely friendship, an ancient dragon cult was born in the capital city, and the Knights of Leyndell learned to worship the dragons and wield their lightning. Lanceaxe, sister of Fortisax, even took human form to better commune with the knights. It was officially decided that the worship of the ancient dragons did not conflict with belief in the Erd Tree, and it was all thanks to Godwin, commander of the dragons' golden lightning, and a true child of the Golden Lineage. But now, let's talk about Morgoth and Moog, the Omen twins, who were also born of Godfrey and Marika's Golden Lineage. First, what is an Omen? Well, to put it simply, an Omen is an accursed child, seen as impure, as they are born with horns on the body and face. When this happens, the correct thing to do, culturally at least, is to cut off the horns of the Omen, an act which usually causes them to perish. It's pretty messed up, but some Omen do survive this process, and some Omen are even given a cleaver crafted specifically for them and awarded as a tool of war, although these weapons are bestowed with a readiness to take them away. We find one such Omen in an Erd Tree camp upon the Altus Plateau. Before you fight it, you might have noticed another Omen nearby, writhing in its sleep. It's said that Omen see evil spirits in their nightmares, and I think this Omen is dreaming, haunted by the vengeful spirits of its accursed kin. This brings us to the Omen killers, who are horrifying butchers of twisted conscience. They wear these horned masks that make a mockery of the Omen's nightmares, and these butchers hunt the Omen and amputate their horns. The first Omen killer was named Rollo, a famous perfumer who had to imbibe a physic to rid himself of emotion, so that he could better perform his tasks. Remember, it seems many Omen have their horns excised when they're very young. That's definitely disturbing enough to warrant an emotion-killing physic in my book. However, if the Omen is born of royalty, then their horns are not cut off, but the Omen is kept underground, unbeknownst to anyone, and imprisoned for eternity. By way of example, you would have seen all kinds of Omen confined to the sewers beneath Leyndell. But why are Omen considered to be accursed in the first place? Some of them are clearly intelligent, so what's inherently wrong with being born with horns and great strength? Well, it's important to remember, I think, that this curse might only really exist in the context of the Golden Order. After all, those afflicted with Omen horns are not able to return to the Ode Tree for rebirth, and are said to be born outside of its grace. But why does the Golden Order disavow the Omen, then? Well, it's hard to say for sure, but my working theory is that it's to do with the Crucible. According to this ancient incantation, horns were once an aspect of the Ode Tree's primordial Crucible, where all life was once blended together. And with the exception of a couple of Crucible knights in and around Leyndell, we know that the Golden Order has started to distance itself from most things that touch upon the Crucible. While things like horns, knots, feathers, and scales once grew on the human body and were considered signifiers of the divine, now they are disdained as impurities as civilization has advanced. We learn this from the knot, scale, and feather talismans, all of which are guarded by Omen, or dropped by Omen killers, no less. Unfortunately for the Order of the Ode Tree, these once-divine impurities seem to crop up in some births, whether they like it or not, almost like it's a genetic trait, as if it touches upon the Crucible at the root of the Ode Tree. And so you have to ask, is it really a curse to be born as a graceless Omen? Well, as with most curses in these games, I think that depends on your perspective. In any case, Moog and Morgoth were Omen royalty, and thus they were born into a wretched mire far below the earth, horns and all. Here, they were kept under the strictest confinement. Each of them were bound with charmed shackles that were covered in roots, or thorns, and bathed in golden magic. It seems very few people were supposed to know that they even existed. Morgoth, for his part, renounced and despised his accursed Omen blood, but his brother Moog embraced it. Deep underground, Moog stood before an outer god, a being called the Formless Mother, who craves wounds, a being capable of bestowing power upon accursed blood. In this moment, Moog's accursed blood erupted with fire, and he became besotted with the defilement that he was born into. Here, deep below the earth, he would go on to build a dynasty of blood in reverence of a mother, something it seems he never truly had. As for Morgoth, he was born into the same accursed fate as his twin brother, but despite not being blessed with grace, he loved the Ode Tree all the same, and even took it upon himself to crawl out of the sewers and become the Ode Tree's protector when the Ode Tree needed him most. In the end, he rightfully became the Omen King and Lord of Leyndell. Omen or not, he was, after all, born of Godfrey and Marika's golden lineage. Of course, the marriage between Godfrey and Marika would be ended, and before long, Marika remarried with another man, a champion named Radagon, who Marika calls her other half. He became second Elden Lord and the king consort, but he also brought with him three children from a previous marriage that he had had with a carrion queen named Rennala. These children were Ranni, Raikard, and Radan, and they all became demigod stepchildren after Radagon's union, reunion, with Queen Marika. Possessed of his father's flaming red hair, Radan was fond of its heroic implications and considered himself to be born of a great champion, yet he also looked up to another man, Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, Queen Marika's first husband and the Lord of the Battlefield. But Radan wasn't just the son of Radagon and an aspiring Lord of the Battlefield, he was also the son of Rennala, who was head of the Academy of Raya Lucaria and Queen of Caria. So as a carrion royal inclined towards sorcery, Radan bent his will towards mastering gravitational magics, rock sling, gravity well, collapsing stars. These techniques were taught to him in Celia, the town of sorcery, all so he would never have to abandon his beloved but scrawny steed. That said, before long, his powers would be put towards a more cosmic purpose than simply allowing him to ride his own horse. Radan was taught gravitational magic by an Alabaster Lord, a member of a race of ancients with skin of stone who was said to have risen to life when a meteor struck long ago. And when his lessons were complete, Radan uttered these chilling words. Thank you for your tutelage. For now, I can challenge the stars. And of course, he did conquer the stars, and the very constellations would be halted by his strength. But of course, you kind of have to ask why? Why was it necessary to conquer the stars in the first place? Well, I have a couple of theories. Theory one is that it was done in self-defense. After all, according to the Sword Gravestone, Radan was protecting Celia. What's more, gravitational magic has destructive power, and many gravitational beasts are proof of that destructive power. A being named Astel had even come down to the Lands Between in the past and destroyed a place called the Eternal City. What's more, Celians are descendants of the Eternal, positioned right above the Eternal City underground, so there is an argument to be made for Radan purely defending Celia for some reason here. But it's possible for Radan to have fought in this conflict and to have made the first move as well. So this is theory two, that Radan conquered the stars as a preventative measure, in service to the greater will. According to a set of astrologer items, the night sky cradles fate. There's even a banished sect of people called the Nox, who live deep below the Earth in eternal anticipation of the coming age of stars and their lord of night. Long ago, these people invoked the ire of the greater will. So it would make sense that those in service to the greater will might have sought to arrest the stars and put an end to this fate. What's more, Radan was just a huge fanboy of Godfrey, and he seems to have more loyalty to the Erd tree than to the moon. Finally, the telescope item description says that the fate once writ in the night skies had been fettered by the Golden Order. So surely this is referencing Radan's actions, and it levels the blame at the Golden Order. But putting Radan's motivations aside, it's a fact that the stars were held back, and that this had great consequences for many, especially for the rest of his carrion royal family. Let me explain. The fate of the carrion royal family is guided by the stars, as is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the carrion royal line. But General Radan is the conqueror of the stars, who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory. And so, if General Radan were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement, as would Lady Ranni's destiny. Lunar Princess Ranni was the daughter of Radagon and Ranala, and sister to Radan. Interestingly, if you look at her true body atop the Divine Tower, it looks like she might have also inherited the red hair of Radagon. Cool detail. But unlike her brother, Radan, she quite clearly took after her mother, Maw, who was Ranala, head of the carrion royal family. The House of Caria has this storied history, one that seems to go way back to the astrologers. In the carrion manor, we find one of their treasures, the Sword of Night and Flame. It reads, Astrologers who preceded the sorcerers established themselves in mountaintops that nearly touched the sky and considered the fire giants their neighbors. Ranala herself was an astrologer, always chasing the stars in her youth. Then she met the full moon, and in time, the astrologer became a queen, establishing the House of Caria as royalty. Caria appears to have a matriarchal hierarchy, with multiple princesses and carrion knights that serve as their retainers. Now, however, there is only one princess, Ranni, daughter of Ranala. And at the time of her birth, she would have been set to inherit quite a lot of power indeed, for the carrion royal family was at its height, and her mother was not only queen, she was also head of the Academy of Raya Lucaria, having bewitched them with the enchanting power of the full moon. Leading the young Ranni by the hand, Ranala guided her daughter to a meeting with a moon of her own. What Ranni beheld was cold, dark, and veiled in occult mystery. A dark moon, a sort of twin to Ranala's own full moon. You can even see both of these hanging in the sky if you stargaze from the heights of the moonlight plateau. Another who guided Ranni was a character called the Snowy Crone, who the young Ranni encountered deep in the woods. When you look at Ranni, it's actually the likeness of this snow witch that you're seeing, as the doll that now houses Ranni's soul was modeled after her, probably as a sign of respect. Clearly, Ranni looked up to this mysterious woman. She became Ranni's secret mentor, and she even knew about the dark moon, teaching the young Ranni to fear it as she imparted her cold sorceries. So, what do these moons represent? That's just a theory, but I think the moons kind of act as guides. The Lost Black Moon of Noxtella, for example, was the guide of countless stars. What's more, Ranni and Rennala were heavily influenced by their moons. Rennala's moon bewitched the academy that she became the head of, and Ranni's dark moon, for its part, also imparts wisdom and leads a voyage in the Age of Stars ending. They could even be outer gods. And yet, for all of this guidance, Caria and Leonia as a whole have experienced steep decline. Radagon betrayed the House of the Moon. Radan locked the stars out of motion. The academy town is flooded to the north. Caria has been ruined in the west, and the stars and moon have gone their separate ways. Nevertheless, Ranni, last princess of Caria, remains, carefully setting new plans into motion. Sibling to Ranni and Radan was a man named Rykard, who was lord of the Volcano Manor. There is evidence that Rykard was friendly with his siblings. He conspired with his sister Ranni later on, and there's even a portrait of Radan hung in the Volcano Manor, as well as a portrait of Rykard himself before the fall. Item descriptions mark Rykard as stern, ambitious, heroic, and blasphemous. A part of this blasphemy was opposing the Ode Tree, which actually drew many knights to his banner, for Rykard believed in taking by force, just as the gods did, and clearly many believed that he would usher in a new age. The armor set of the Gelmir knights reveals to us what were once very loyal soldiers. The crest of red feathers are there to symbolize Rykard's pedigree, as Lord Radagon's son, and the emblem upon their chest piece represents a lord who had lofty ambitions. However, as Rykard delved into the ancient secrets of Mount Gelmir, he came across the immortal Great Serpent, an ancient deity that aligned with Rykard's ambitions. And so, Rykard fed himself to the Great Serpent, so that he might devour, grow, and live eternally. Alas, this was too much for his knights, and they believed that their master's heroic ambitions had degenerated into mere greed. So they searched desperately for a weapon with which they might hold their lord, and they found it too. The immortal serpent had lived for a long time, and so there was also a weapon to kill it that had been designed long ago as well. A serpent hunter. But it was too late. As the lord lost his dignity, so too did the knights lose their master. Not that it bothered Rykard. Hmm, now we can devour all gods together. Next, we need to discuss Melania and Mikala. These two were twins as they were born. No, Rykard, please. Anyway, as you know, Radagon's marriage with Rennala did not last. Afterwards, he returned to the Golden Order and became Queen Marika's consort. What I haven't yet mentioned is that, together, they were blessed with two demigod children, the so-called twin prodigies. Now, in the last lore video, I briefly proposed that these two twins were born after the Shattering, after Radagon and Marika had merged together to become a single god. However, I've since changed my mind, I think Milenia and Michaela were clearly born before the Shattering. There's just so much proof that these two twins were a force that were influencing the world long before the Shattering took place. Anyway, both of these twins were born afflicted. Specifically, in the Japanese text, it's said that their births were vulnerable. Michaela was born afflicted with eternal youth, and Milenia, for her part, was vulnerable to rot. Interestingly, Milenia's Scarlet Rot is actually an outer god. This outer god, like many others in the game, seems to have an order that is able to be imposed upon the world via an Empyrean vessel, and Milenia was that vessel. And while the Scarlet Rot is pretty terrible, you can sort of argue that it's got a beauty to it. According to Gowri, the order of rot is resplendent. It's a cycle of death and rebirth. Kind of like the Lotus Flower, which is a flower that blooms anew, beautiful and fresh from mud. I actually have art of this flower hanging in my home, I always love the symbol of it. I actually have lots of art hanging now, and I'm going to talk about all of this artwork that you can buy at the end of the video. Anyway, so Milenia the Empyrean was vulnerable to, and afflicted by, the Scarlet Rot. There was said to be no cure to this, and while fire and consecration seemed to be somewhat effective at warding it off, Milenia would slowly lose her physical self to the rot. Interestingly, old legends of the Scarlet Rot have persisted in the world for generations, and we learn more about the Rot God from the Blue Dancer charm. The dancer in blue represents a fairy, who, in legend, bestowed a flowing sword upon a blind swordsman. Played in hand, the swordsman sealed away an ancient god, a god that was rot itself. Specifically, this god was long ago sealed away in the stagnant water that is downstream of the Ainsel River underground. And wherever rot appears, the kindred of rot appear as well. These are pests, and servants of the rot. And now, in the current age, these are servants that have been forsaken by Milenia, who is their new goddess. So this blind swordsman, with the flowing curved sword, actually went on to become Milenia's mentor. So technically, it's him that we have to blame for this goddamn attack. The prosthesis wearer heirloom tells us more. A talisman engraved with a scene from a heroic tale. Though born into the accursed rot, when the young girl encountered her mentor and his flowing blade, she gained wings of unparalleled strength. Milenia's ridiculous attack is called the Waterfowl Dance, and aesthetically, it makes sense that flowing waters would counter the effects of rot. Therefore, just as still waters turn foul, stagnation turns to decay. Thus, warriors must remain ever drifting. And indeed, Milenia does resist the call of the rot. There's a lot of evidence that she's not really a willing vessel, but through sheer will and sense of self, she resists the rot. And only when she is truly pressed in battle will she abandon this will, and bloom into the goddess within. Milenia's first bloom was during her fight against Redan, and releasing her scarlet rot was a last-ditch effort that would forever taint the land of Caled and cripple Redan. So whatever she was fighting for in this fight against Redan, somehow it was worth this terrible act. In general terms at least, it's clear that Milenia was fighting for her brother. Apart from the times where she relapses into being the goddess of rot, she is known as the Blade of Michaela. She actually goes to great lengths to tell you this, I don't know if you heard. Despite being the toughest boss in FromSoftware history, she's actually fighting for his right to godhood, not her own. In Milenia's own words, her brother Michaela possesses the wisdom, the allure of a god. He is the most fearsome Empyrean of all. For his part, Michaela did a lot to earn his sister's dedication, not the least of which was inspiring her armor and a prosthetic of unalloyed gold. It is not just his sister that loved Michaela, many people did. The Bewitching Branch is an item that you can use to turn enemies into temporary allies, and it reads, Indeed, he has learned very well how to compel such affection. For his father Radagon, Michaela fashioned and gifted to him a fundamentalist incantation called Triple Rings of Light. Radagon then returns the favor, gifting back an incantation called Radagon's Rings of Light. These interactions show some of Michaela's positive connections with his father, and also Golden Order fundamentalism. And yet, the young Michaela abandoned fundamentalism, for it could do nothing to treat Milenia's accursed rot. This was the beginning of unalloyed gold. So, what is unalloyed gold? Well, an alloy is a composition of metals, so unalloyed gold is pure gold, essentially, with no external mixtures. This gold apparently can ward away the meddling of outer gods, and so Michaela bent a lot of his efforts towards creating an unalloyed gold needle. Specifically, this needle was crafted for his sister, to ward off the Rot God, and forestall the effects of the incurable rotting sickness. We see the bond between the siblings as well, when we visit Michaela's Halic Tree. We see a statue of a one-armed woman embracing a child, Michaela. In this place, we see the biggest example of Michaela's benevolence, the Halic Tree, and the society that was built into the brace that supports it. This was a promised land, seen as a salvation to many who were shunned or persecuted, provided that they can actually find the path here, of course. Like many other Empyreans, Michaela seems to have had the will within them to create a new order, and his is an order that's somewhat modelled on the ones that came before it. The biggest thing is that the Halic Tree is clearly inspired by the Ood Tree. But the difference is that Michaela's Halic Tree is said to be accepting of all, even those the Ood Tree shuns. Michaela himself was once embedded inside of the Halic Tree, and he watered it with his very own blood since it was a mere sapling. Tragically, however, he was ripped out of this womb during the Shattering, and his Halic Tree ultimately failed to grow into an Ood Tree, becoming a misshapen husk instead. But that's the story for another day. There's also a ton of cut content to do with Michaela, and he's one of the most mysterious demigods, who I'm sure we'll learn about more later. But there is one more thing I want to mention before I go, it's kind of one theory I had during the making of this video. So Michaela and Milenia each have their own butterflies. Milenia's is the Aeonian Butterfly, which inhabit the Swamp of Aeonia, and are rumoured to come from the wings of the Rot Goddess herself. But I think it's fair to say that Michaela's butterfly is the Nascent Butterfly, which appears as if it's just emerged from its cocoon for its entire life. This is a reference to Michaela's eternal youth, and his cocoon in the Halic Tree. But there is, of course, a third butterfly, right? There's the Smouldering Butterfly. It's said to be an eternally burning butterfly that serves as kindling. Bear with me, but it's my theory that this butterfly is a reference to Melina, who the Blade of Calling calls the Kindling Maiden, and the one who walks alongside flame. This might suggest that Melina is a sibling to Milenia and Michaela. Again, that's just a theory, but what I really want to talk about here is that, at the very least, Melina is almost certainly the daughter of Marika. We learned this a long time ago, from looking at her name in the game's files. We can further infer it from her dialogue, as she has a few lines that refer to mothers, and one that says that she was born inside the Erd Tree. So her being the daughter of Marika is also just a theory, but this one is much more concrete than the butterfly one. Although the reason I like the butterfly theory is that it gives us a hint as to who Melina's parents might have been. Her parents would have been Radagon and Marika. Which is to say, Marika herself alone, I guess, because Radagon is Marika. Honestly, Melina as a character has only become more mysterious since the game was released, and I'm really only scratching the surface with this theory. But speaking of times before Elden Ring was released, back then, a long time ago, I commissioned this piece from a renowned artist named Marco, and now I'm so excited to reveal it for the first time. This storybook scene is heavily inspired by the early looks we had at Elden Ring, with a red-haired protagonist, spirit companions, a mount that looks like Yakul, and a bit like Torrent, and a few other hidden details in the piece. This piece, and all of my other prints, are now available over at Spring, where you can actually buy them fully framed and ready to hang. They actually ship with a beautiful frame. The frame itself is a nice black satin finish, and you can even opt for a white border around the print, which I think looks really classy in certain cases. I think these posters are a cool way to support the channel and artists, and for you to actually get something in return that will make your room look better. So check out my prints if you're interested. But this is the end, and thank you for watching. I'll see you next time.\n",

      "[Doc 5: The Lore of Elden Ring's Bosses (feat. Death's Kindred)]\n",
      "Where do you go after death? What is the right way to die? Can death be overcome? And if it can, what are the consequences of such a thing? These questions are at the very heart of Elden Ring's story, and in order to answer them, I want to go over a set of bosses that are defined by their relationship to death. Those being the Deathbirds, the Ancestral Spirits, the Tibia Mariners, the Godskins, the Burial Watchdogs, and the Black Knife Assassins. Understanding these bosses will teach you so much. In Elden Ring, one's self is separated into two distinct entities. There's the body, which is one's physical self, or corporeal flesh, and then there's the spirit, which is essentially the soul that commonly persists after death. In the Age of the Urd Tree, the bodies of the dead and their spirits are returned to the Urd Tree. This is done via a process called Urd Tree Burial, where Great Tree Roots in Catacomb Dungeons absorb the dead, so that they might be immortalised with the Urd Tree. But it was not always this way. In fact, the entire culture of death had a different shape in the earlier days of the Lands Between. Back then, instead of Urd Tree Burial, death commonly burned in Ghost Flame. Ghost Flame, also known as Spirit Flame, is a cold white flame that is created when bones are burned to ash. We learn this from the Fallen Hawks who prowl the underground rivers. When the last embers of their torches were used up, they were forced to burn the bones of their fellows instead, and acquired the cold ghost flame. This process appears to help separate the spirit from the body. And while a lot of these spirits appear to be vengeful, based on the ghost flame spells, I think in general, having the body separated from the spirit in this way would have been a desired outcome. I speculate that we see proof of this even in the current age, where the wandering dead at Egil Lake gaze at the sky, praying that the dragon Egil might burn them to ash. Perhaps this was simply the acceptable way to put a tired body to rest. The keepers of ghost flame were the death birds, who tended to the flame in their graveyards, raking out the ashen remains of the dead from their kilns. So I like to think of the death birds as serving the old process of death, and delivering death by reducing bodies to ash so that spirits might be better able to move on. Admittedly, a lot of these spirits are vengeful, and that's how ghost flame is weaponised by the death birds and sorcerers, but I do think that at its core, ghost flame was important just because it separated the body and the spirit. After all, the explosive ghost flame sorcery compares this process of death to the Erd Tree's process of death, which was pretty all-encompassing, so I think it's safe to assume that ghost flame was just really important to the process of death, and it was more than just vengeful spirits and a weapon to be used. Next we should talk about the Twinbird, which was the mother of the death birds. We don't find this creature in-game, but we can find its likeness painted vividly upon a kite shield that one of the death birds drops. The design might remind you of a phoenix, which is traditionally drawn with bright colours and a crest of feathers and a longish neck. Of course, the phoenix is a creature that rises from the ash when it dies, which is obviously extremely fitting for this story. So the kite shield tells us that the Twinbird, or this phoenix creature, is said to be the mother of the death birds, but not only that, it's also called the Envoy of an Outer God. So we can kind of compare the Twinbird to the Two Fingers, then, who are also Envoys to an Outer God. They are Envoys to the Greater Will, and similarly, I assume the Twinbird probably communes with some Outer God of Death. And while we're definitely left wondering what greater purpose this Outer God might have, the mere fact that it exists lends a lot of significance to the Twinbird, and its death birds as well. A variation on the death bird is the Death Right Bird, which is an alternate boss, and it's a far more threatening foe, as it actually seems to use power that it's gained from certain spirits and ghost flame. And if you look really closely at its ethereal wings, you might even spy little spirits lurking within. And when I saw these, I was really excited, because I recognised the weapon they're using, and the weapon explains who they are. They're holding a little death ritual spear, and that item reads, The priests became the guardians of the birds through the rite of death, which is a part of their contract for a far-off resurrection. So death birds have a lot to do with sacrificial rites, they don't just attend to the ghost flame, they also deliver death, and they also perform rites of death. So we can assume that these priests were sacrificed in a rite of death, so that they could lend a sort of spiritual strength to the death birds. But we're still left wondering about the nature of their contract with the death birds, which promises a far-off resurrection for them. What agreement did these priests come to with the death birds? What has to happen for their contract to be fulfilled, and how will they even be resurrected? In terms of where the death birds appear, they kind of appear everywhere, and I think that might be a hint that their influence was once present far and wide. And while their importance in the current age is likely quite diminished, they still definitely are relevant in the lands between, in fact, many other enemies actually make reference to them, and some even successfully channel their powers. Even ghost flame lights the way in catacomb dungeons to this day. But in general, there is a lot of power that can be gained from death in the lands between, which brings us to the ancestral spirit. In the flourishing landscapes underneath the lands between, you would have found the bodies of three large stags, enshrined by the ancestral followers. These warriors, hunters, and shamans believe heavily in the principle that life sprouts from birth, but also from death. I think this principle is sort of represented by horns, because in real life, horns continue to grow throughout the lifespans of animals, with their primary function usually being to convey a social hierarchy. And here, the largest and most influential creature is a giant stag, and in the world of Elden Ring, since life continues after death, it makes sense then that this creature's antlers continue to bud and grow even after its death. We learn this from defeating the regal ancestor spirit, and looking at the horn of this fallen king. New growths bud, glowing with light. Thus does new life grow from death, and from death, one obtains power. Long-lived beasts like this are worshipped by the ancestral followers, a race of beings who keep their distance from the Ood tree, and are just content to await new buds and new growth. If a being does not show signs of budding horns or new growth, then they are sacrificed with an axe called the winged great horn. Interestingly, the twin blades of this sacrificial axe are called envoy's wings, which might be a reference to the twin bird we mentioned earlier, which was also a winged envoy. According to the horn charm talismans, the ancestral spirits specifically arise from long-lived beasts, and I think this touches on another commonly repeated theme in Elden Ring, which is that there are benefits to living life to its fullest potential. To quote some more death bird items, the most glorious end awaits those who cling tenaciously to life, and it is important to render up a death worth offering. Those who lived a heroic life were even able to go on and see a unique version of grace in the afterlife. We currently think that this grace is red, and that these are the same red rays of grace that you might have noticed when you first explored the Forbidden Lands. This might be the most intriguing part of the video, let me explain. Past the Forbidden Lands, and deep within the consecrated snowfields, is a Tibia Mariner, and this one drops Helfand Steeple, a greatsword that reveals just a mind-blowing amount of lore for one item. First it reads, Greatsword patterned after the black steeple of the Helfand, the lampwood which guides the dead of the spirit world. So the word steeple is commonly used to describe the tall spire found on churches, and indeed, the design of Helfand's steeple echoes that of the Morion Blade from Dark Souls, which also referenced the spire of a church. However, while I think Helfand is likely to be a sort of church, I don't think it's a building. This item seems to be describing the shape of a black tree in the spirit world, a so-called lampwood, or lamplight tree, that serves as a guidepost for the heroic dead. The item goes on to say that lamplight is similar to grace in appearance, and it is said that it can only be seen by heroic spirits, or those who met their death in battle. So the black tree of Helfand is almost like this dark mirror of the Ood tree, but in the spirit world. It's so interesting that it even gives off its own guidance of grace, and there's a few reasons we speculate that this grace might be red. First, a red gem can be found at the very tip of Helfand's steeple, and a gem on the rolled medallion as well. Plus, there's a red glow visible from the sword's gem, and a red glow from the rolled medallion when you hold it up at the Grand Lift, where it takes you to the Forbidden Lands, where we speculate that you can briefly glimpse this lamplight, or red grace, filtering between the trees. So you might be asking, why can we see the grace, when we're not dead? But technically, Tarnished are defined as the dead who yet live, so it might make some sense that we can see it. The next question is, where does the lamplight lead? I think there's two options. One is that the lamplight might lead back to Helfand itself. That is the source of the light, after all, and Helfand's steeple can be wreathed in ghost flames, so maybe the dead are sort of put to rest here. Alternatively, I guess it's also possible that the lamplight has plans for the heroic dead, just like grace has plans for the Tarnished. It might lead them somewhere else as well. We just don't know. In my discussions with Quelaag, who helped with these theories, she pointed out the similarities that Helfand has with Valhalla of Nordic folklore. If you don't know, Valhalla is a place where brave spirits would be invited to dine with the gods, and it seems that Helfand is inspired by that same sort of folklore, since only heroic spirits can see the light. Not to mention, Hel, with one L, is actually the name of the world of the dead in Nordic folklore. And speaking of folklore, this finally brings us back to the Tibia Mariner, the boss that dropped Helfand's steeple in the first place. The Tibia Mariners themselves actually have no written lore to speak of, which is kind of a shame. What they do have is an incredible visual design, and it kind of carries them from a lore perspective, because this visual design is steeped very heavily in appropriate folklore. So in Greek mythology, there is a stretch of water called the River Styx, which marks the boundary between earth and the underworld. And to help souls of the deceased cross this river, you have to find the River Boatman, and pay him to safely take you across. Just so, I kind of imagine the dead in Elden Ring are being drawn to the Tibia Mariner in a similar fashion. He has a purple lantern and a loud horn, and he might offer a similar sort of guidance to the underworld. There is one spell that references this boss briefly, it's Tibia's Summons, and it says Suffice to say, death was a very important facet of life in the Lands Between, even for the gods at one point. Which brings us to the Godskins, an order of apostles that were born to deliver destined deaths to the gods long ago. I kind of like to think of them as a counterbalancing force to the influence of gods, wielding sharp tools for boring and slicing through flesh, and encanting spells that mocked the wrath of the gods. It seems these godskins actually succeeded in hunting many gods, if their name is to be believed. Their robes were made by sewing together patches of smooth skin, and the nobles' robes include subcutaneous fat which makes them plump and soft. Known for their seven-faced aprons, these nobles are the most ancient apostles, and deeply inhuman. Their weapon is not a slicer, but a stitcher, and they wield it with a skill that is unmatched by any lowborn. These beings were elevated to a social class above the lowborn because they served a queen, a Glomite Queen. The black flames they wield are actually channeled from that queen's greatsword, and it was this queen who raised them from birth in the first place, cradling her newborn apostles in godskin cloth so that they might grow to become the death of the gods. This Glomite Queen was powerful, but what makes her character so important is that she was also an Empyrean chosen by the fingers. Now remember, an Empyrean is a candidate chosen by the two fingers to become a god, so despite being such a dark character, the Glomite Queen was still a valid choice for godhood. And all of this, of course, was before the Rune of Death had been removed from the Elden Ring, and it was from this Rune of Death that the Black Flame originally got its power. We only know of one other Empyrean alive at this time, and that would have been Queen Marika. Naturally, at some point, Marika and the Glomite Queen clashed, though according to the Godslayer Greatsword description, we know that the Glomite Queen was defeated by Malekith, who was the shadow of Queen Marika. He is credited with defeating the Glomite Queen and the Apostles, and sealing off the Rune of Death, which again, was the source of their power. What's not clear to me about all of this, though, is whether Marika and the Glomite Queen were rival Empyreans competing for godhood, or if Marika was already a god and decided to take out the Glomite Queen because the Glomite Queen was an Empyrean threat to her age. At any rate, it seems like Marika and the Glomite Queen are opposites. The Glomite Queen ends ages, but Marika wished for an age eternal, so it makes sense that they'd clash, but there's still so much we don't know about them. But after all of this, Marika's age of the Ood Tree began, and during this age, you were supposed to wait for the roots of the Ood Tree to call to you, so that your spirit could return to the Ood Tree after death to be immortalised with it. Specifically, these roots were found in Catacomb Dungeons, and there's even a statue found across the Lands Between that was designed to help people find these Catacomb Dungeons. This is the statue of Roses, the Usher of Death, and he shows the dead the path towards Catacomb Dungeons. The Catacombs themselves were built in the Age of the Ood Tree. This is proven by Root Resin, which states that the roots here were once linked to the Ood Tree, and it was for this reason that Catacombs were constructed around these great tree roots. So, at this point in history, Queen Marika had implemented her new concept for death in the Lands Between, and in her eyes, a proper death meant returning to the Ood Tree. Thus, in the days where Catacomb roots were connected to the Ood Tree, these Catacombs were valid sites of Ood Tree burial, and I think we literally see this taking place, as corpses can be seen being absorbed by the roots at the end of every Catacomb Dungeon. The process of Ood Tree burial, though, is described as an honour reserved for heroes, and this process of Ood Tree burial is presided over by Ood Tree Burial Watchdogs, who protect the Catacombs with their impish servants. These creatures are golems, and I think that they might have been created specifically during the period of history where Leonia had an allegiance with Leyndell, since they serve the process of Ood Tree burial, but their weapons actually have glintstone embedded in them. Furthermore, when hit by impure crystal darts, they malfunction, which I think is further proof of their glintstone origins. In some Catacombs and Graveyards, the physical bodies of the dead have begun to rise. These beings are defined as those who live in death, and they are a relatively recent phenomenon in the Lands Between. Instead of having their body and spirit return to the Ood Tree, they rise, in an act that is completely at odds with Marika's concept of death, Ood Tree Burial, and the Golden Order. I'll go into more detail on this later when we talk about Godwin, but basically, this all began when Ranni stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Malekith, and then she imparted its power onto the knives of the Black Knife Assassins. You can tell the Assassins have quite a lot of secrets in their lore. We do know a few things, though. We know that they're all women, they're all Numen, and they have links to Queen Marika and the Eternal City as well. We'll have to go into more detail on them later, though. But with their knives imbued with the Rune of Death, they carved a curse mark into two demigods, Ranni and Godwin. The curse mark itself is an obtainable item, and it reads, This curse mark was carved at the moment of death of the first demigod, and should have taken the shape of a circle. However, two demigods perished at the same time, breaking the curse mark into two half-wheels. Ranni was the first of the demigods whose flesh perished, while the Prince of Death perished in Sol alone. So, interestingly, these assassins and the knives imbued with the Rune of Death had the power to cleave life from the physical body and from the spirit as well. Specifically, Ranni was the one whose flesh perished, and she became a disembodied spirit, free from her corporeal flesh, which is what she wanted, and she now occupies a doll. But Godwin became the Prince of Death, living without a soul, and spreading the Rune of Death across the lands between through Deathroot. Now, according to item descriptions, Deathroot is the Rune of Death itself, and it acts as a source that gives rise to those who live in death. Now, what I find really interesting is the fact that this Rune of Death, that is embodied by Deathroot and those who live in death, it clearly has aspects of both death and life as well, which makes sense based on what you should have learned from this episode, right? Because death isn't just the end, it's life as well. So, it makes sense that those who live in death would have aspects of death and life, all contained in these beings that were brought to life, in a sense, by the Rune of Death. And while those who live in death are a bit unnatural, because they do come from this fragmented Rune of Death, this half of a curse mark, they still have life in death, and so you can argue that they still have a right to life. And in fact, that's entirely what one of the endings is about, at least how I understand it. And I'll try to explore it more thoroughly later on. These beings are persecuted and hunted down by Fundamentalists of the Golden Order, and whether these Fundamentalists are truly serving the Fundamentals of Order in the first place is just a topic that is very interesting to explore. So, in conclusion, maybe it shouldn't be a sin to live in death. After all, to quote F.E.A.R., in death, there is only peace, or in death, there can be no sensation. Thank you for watching. Special thanks to Quelaag for looking over this script. She has an awesome channel that you really should go and check out, and it's been great to have someone to just discuss my ideas with. But I'd also like to thank EVE, the sponsor of this video, who'd like me to talk about Spectrum, which is their high-end gaming monitor. Now, I ignore 99% of the sponsorship emails that come my way, but this one caught my eye because I follow a lot of tech YouTubers, and I already knew that they had a lot of good things to say about this product. So, I'll leave links to those more detailed reviews in the description, but let me just explain a little bit about the EVE Spectrum first. So, the Spectrum is a high-end product, and it has a high, but fair, price tag to match. It's a 27-inch panel with tiny bezels, and at 4K resolution, games like Elden Ring look absolutely gorgeous. I've also been blown away by the color accuracy and clarity of this monitor while editing. Furthermore, if you're into any competitive FPS games, you'll especially love that it also has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time, which is very impressive considering it also does 4K resolution. The thing I like most, though, is that even with all of these gamer specs, it presents as a clean, professional monitor without any RGB or overt branding. If you're in the market for a high-end monitor, then you can click the links in the description to pick one up yourself. But, thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time. you\n",

      "[Doc 6: The Lore of Elden Ring's Bosses (that served the Golden Order)]\n",
      "Many of Elden Ring's bosses serve Marika's Golden Order in some shape or form, whether they're loyal to it, or enslaved by it. So let's discuss all of these bosses, starting at a time before Order had even come to the Lands Between. To the north are Mountaintops of the Giants, a name that makes it abundantly clear just who dominated this region of the world. However, it was not always this way. According to the Borealis' Myst incantation, the Ice Dragons were once lords of the mountaintops long ago, until they were defeated by the Fire Giants and chased from the peak. And perched upon this peak stands an enormous forge. Interestingly, the chain rings of this forge depict dragons, which might be a reference to the dragons that once dwelled here. And while I don't think we can say for sure who built this forge, the art of smithing is said to have originated among the giants, and the craft was even once considered divine. So it seems likely that at the very least, they made good use of this fire. Sparks from this forge would fall down and fertilize the smoldering flowers that bloomed upon the mountaintops, and it seems like it was a pretty crucial part of life in this region. The most ancient giants here were called Fire Giants, and according to the Burn of Flame incantation, they have long held a solitary curse to serve as keepers of the flame for eternity. Now traditionally in FromSoftware games, curses are the domain of the gods, and indeed, the Fire Giants are cited to have borrowed power from one such god, who is represented here by a single large red eye. This god is called a God of the Flame, and it's believed to be able to inhabit fire itself, as well as the bodies of the Fire Giants who worshipped it. The giants shared borders with the astrologers, who, according to their legendary Sword of Night and Flame, established themselves in the mountaintops and considered the Fire Giants their neighbors. The relationship here is implied to be friendly, even collaborative, maybe, as the sword does combine the power of both flame and the power of the primeval current that's glimpsed within the night sky. The sword would go on to become a treasure of the Carian royal family, and the Carians themselves are likely descendants of the astrologers. Generations later, these Carian royals would call upon their old giant allies for aid, but we'll get to that in a moment. The Fire Giants also had another neighbor with whom relations were not so amicable. Further down the mountains, just past the Forbidden Lands, roamed the Knights of Zamor. According to their armor, these long-lived warriors clad in biting, freezing winds are said to have been the mortal enemies of the Fire Giants since time immemorial. According to their weaponry, these beings were devoted to winter itself and had weapons styled after icy winds and bodies that were cloaked in swirling ice storms. It makes good sense that such cold beings would be natural mortal enemies of the Fire Giants, and they commonly did challenge their larger rivals. But it seems like their true chance came when Queen Marika waged war against the Fire Giants, and the Knights of Zamor gladly joined her offensive. They earned great renown amongst the Order of the Erd Tree, and many ancient heroes of Zamor became hailed as heroes, as the Fire Giants were largely wiped from the face of the earth after this war. Now, up until now, I've resisted calling the Giants evil, but the reality is that in pretty much every item description, their god is described as a fel god, and the Giants' flame is a flame of ruin. And to be fair, their god doesn't seem like a super nice guy. I mean, it only really opens its eye when the Fire Giant boss sacrifices a leg, which is pretty metal, but I'm sort of giving them the benefit of the doubt because I think it's pretty clear who's writing the history about this fel god here. The many mentions of this god as evil clearly come about because fire itself was just this extremely taboo topic during Marika's age of the Erd Tree. And it's not just Giants' flame items that mention this. Fire in general was prohibited to those who served the Erd Tree, which was a pretty smart defensive measure, especially considering that many rival outer gods also have a flame of their own. The Formless Mother has blood flame. The Three Fingers have frenzied flame. The Outer God of Death has ghost flame. But Giants' flame in particular was capable of burning the Erd Tree, and that is a fact that clearly inspired the inevitable war with the Giants. So the Giants were deemed mortal enemies of the Erd Tree, and they allegedly desolated nature, triggered avalanches, and whipped up storms of flame with their roars. Clearly, those who served the Erd Tree were afraid, and perhaps rightfully so. And so, led by Lord Godfrey, the forces of the Erd Tree went to war. The Fire Giants borrowed from the power of the Fel God to fight against the Erd Tree, but were defeated nonetheless. According to the Burnow Flame incantation, this released the Fire Giants from their curse to serve as keepers of the flame, all except one, who the Fel God still hides within. And upon realizing that the Giants' flame would never die, Marika left this last giant alive, knowing it was bound to protect the flame for all eternity, and thus leaving it cursed. Cursed to protect the flame from someone like us. In addition to the Knights of Zamor, many lesser giants were also roped into the war against the Fire Giants. These lesser giants are called Trolls, and are confirmed to be a race that is descended from the Giants. This relationship is clearer at the mountaintops, where the Trolls here still cast Giants' flame incantations. Troll hammers were even once used as ancient ceremonial smithing tools. Thus it seems evident that the Trolls and the Fire Giants coexisted for a time, and then fell further and further apart. Because while some Trolls are assumedly still Fire Giants at heart, many now are not. In fact, at the heart of most Trolls is nothing. There's this suspicious hollow here, almost as if something has been ripped out of their torso. And when you consider what's upon the torso of the last remaining Fire Giant, the truth becomes pretty clear, right? Every single Troll is now missing that giant eye of their outer god. And if you manage to look really closely here at a Troll, we realize that in its place is this strange stone tablet that is held in place by what look like roots. As pointed out by Quelaag, these rooted tablets are very reminiscent of the rooted shackles that were created to bind the Omen twins, Moog and Morgoth. Which might suggest that the Trolls are also being shackled or suppressed by Marika in some way. This is just speculation, of course, but Marika does have this suspicious set of stone tablets in her chambers, and I think it's a good theory for sure. A sword gravestone in the mountaintops elaborates further on the Trolls' role in the War of the Giants. Here, champions battled, and allegedly, the Trolls betrayed. But what was the nature of this betrayal? Did these lesser giants resent their larger kin? Or did Marika force this betrayal in some way with the stone shackles? I think that's largely up to you guys. But whatever the case, nowadays the Trolls are said to have lost their minds and are inseparable from the weight of their rusty swords, which have long since lost any trace of gold. So whether they carry coffins or mine down at the bedrock of the earth, their sad state brings to mind enslavement now more than anything else. That said, some Trolls do seem to have a little bit more dignity, and these are the ones that fought against the Ode Tree later on. These were the Enchanted Troll Knights, deemed comrades of the young Rennala. And they were called into service when the Queen invoked an oath that they swore long ago. As mentioned earlier, the Trolls go way back to when the Fire Giants and the Astrologers were still neighbors. And back then, it seems, for whatever reason, they swore an oath to the Astrologers. And later, when the Carians went to war against the Ode Tree, I assume, the Trolls were finally called into that service to be treated as true knights of Carian. Wielding swords embedded with blue glintstone and summoning enormous glint blades, they fought arm-in-arm with their long-lost human comrades. Eegie is another such example of that relationship, by the way. He became the Carian family's royal blacksmith, and unlike the Stonedigger Trolls, he actually uses that weapon for its intended purpose as a blacksmith's hammer. And now he serves the Lady Ranni, who he's known ever since her childhood. Next, I want to talk about the Knights' Cavalry. These recurring bosses wander the dim roads at night, and were once led by the Fel Omen. Now, this description specifically references Margit's title as the Fel Omen, not Morgoth's title as the Omen King. And I think this is important because Margit represents this undercover extension of Morgoth, who scouts further out in the world and takes out champions who approach all the way from Stormvale Castle. Morgoth's big role in the story is that he's a stout defender of the Ode Tree who wouldn't dare betray the Golden Order. He calls all the other demigods willful traitors all, simply for fighting over the great runes of the Elden Ring. Even Redan, who has a lot of signs of being quite loyal to the Golden Order, is called a traitor, simply because he fights at one stage another character who has a great rune. You can even see Morgoth in one of these opening cutscene cinematics leaping onto what looks like Redan, and managing to even get an attack off on one of the mightiest of the demigods. Actually, a channel named Smotown has a really good little video discussing whether this is indeed Redan, and I'd highly recommend you go and check that out. Anyway, my point is, the Knights Cavalry seem to fulfill a similar role to Margit. According to their armor, they were deliverers of death for great warriors, knights, and champions. Simple as that. No motive is listed, except that they have a reputation for taking out the greatest warriors of the world. And that makes sense, that that would be their aim, because only the strongest can acquire two great runes, and approach the Erd Tree, so it's almost as if strength itself must be stifled, so that Morgoth's failing order might be maintained. As for why Margit defends Stormvale, I like to think that he's fighting here because he recognizes that Godric is the weakest of the demigods, who yet remains. So he's bolstering his strength in that sense, and trying to maintain this unsteady stalemate. Having a strong defense is essentially the guiding principle of those who serve the Erd Tree, especially as you get closer to the capital. There are numerous examples of this. The soldiers of Leyndell fight their battles defensively. The knights of Leyndell always put their shield before the sword, and Leyndell itself, the city, is built to withstand siege, with layers and layers of defensive measures built in. And the protective standard to which all defenders of the Erd Tree aspire is that of the Tree Sentinels, whose order became the living rampart of the Erd Tree, embellished with golden tree-crested armor and shields that can retaliate with bolts of light. They turn defense into offense, and that's the idea in Leyndell. Defense is the best offense, and the way this idea is presented is just such beautiful storytelling. So many characters in other areas of the lands between long to return to the blessed land of the Erd Tree, and even for you, it's this goal that looms over you the entire game. So the path is designed to repel everyone getting close. You know, the highway through Leonia has fallen apart, so you need to take this secret waterlogged route up through the mountain. This was my favorite part of the game, by the way, finding this secret path through the mountains and infiltrating the Altus Plateau. And then when you finally get there, there are countless ballista and golem arches, and they're all positioned facing outwards. And finally, you even find a side entrance to Leyndell, and that is even guarded by a tree sentinel. And it's not just any tree sentinel, this one is actually a draconic tree sentinel, which is kind of different. This variant of sentinels arose after the ancient dragons attacked Leyndell in its history, and we talk more about this event in the video about the demigods. But in the end, the ancient dragons were befriended, and worship of the ancient dragons was deemed acceptable alongside belief in the Erd Tree. Dragons were conjoined with the Golden Order, so to speak, and the dragon cultists took after them in a physical fashion. Also instrumental to the rise of the Erd Tree were the Crucible Knights. They were eventually scorned for their strength, for their appearance, and for their close resemblance to chaos and how that inspired who they originally were. Sixteen of these knights served Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, and all sixteen of them yet remain across the lands between. One is imprisoned in an Evergale, two appear to be dead and are summoned to fight you as spirits, a number of Crucible Knights still patrol Leyndell, some protect Great Tree Roots, though most just stand dejected in lost corners of the Earth, and one of them has even found a new blasphemous master. So, the next time you fight these, think carefully about where they are and who they're fighting with, because each knight is a distinct character, with purpose or lack thereof, even though they were all once united by a common purpose and a single lord. Many of these knights fight with different aspects of the Crucible. Some fight with wings, some with horns, fire, and tail, but what they all have in common is their mastery of their Lord Godfrey's signature stomp attack, which breaks up the Earth beneath their feet. This is such a cool homage to Godfrey. You know, knowing the lore is great. It definitely makes dying to it feel a little bit better, right? Anyway, I think it's important to remember that Godfrey and his Crucible Knights existed in an age before the Erd Trees, an age with the Great Tree in its primordial form, back when there was this red-tinted crucible of life, and these were warriors who drew power from its chaos. Eventually, however, they were brought on board with order, which is best exemplified by Godfrey being tamed by the Beast Regent upon his back. There are two types of ornamentation that the Crucible Knights can have. There's axe ornamentation, which is worn by Crucible Knight Ordovus and his men, and I think the axe is a bit of a homage to Godfrey again. And then there are some Knights that have Great Tree ornamentation, and these are displayed by the Knight Seluria and her men, which is, of course, a reference to the Great Tree itself. And I'd like to quickly talk about the Great Tree. In one of my first lore videos, I proposed that there was a Great Tree that must have existed before the Erd Tree, and that the Erd Tree might have even replaced this Great Tree. This was based on the English root resin item description, which has the word Great Tree capitalized and as one word, which certainly makes you think that it's a distinct tree, right? The line is, The roots of the Great Tree, once linked to those of the Erd Tree, which is a line that seems to clearly set up that these are two separate trees. Except the Japanese translation doesn't say that. The Japanese translation says, These roots are said to have once been connected to the Golden Tree. It does mention the Great Tree earlier, but it seems to just be referencing the Erd Tree as that Great Tree, because it is a really big tree. Some people have taken this to mean that there was no Great Tree before the Erd Tree, and, you know, while that's certainly possible, I do think it's still fair to argue that a Great Tree existed before the Erd Tree. For one, many of the Crucible Knight items reference a primordial form of the Erd Tree, and they have ornamentation and history that is based on this primordial holiness that is not the holiness of the Erd Tree. So calling it a Great Tree might just be referencing that tree. And secondly, Siluria defends a giant tree in the Deeproot Depths. It's one that has this hollowed-out entrance that is reminiscent of the entrance at the Erd Tree as well. So maybe there's something here. I just kind of wanted to set that straight for now. But the reality is that we don't really know for sure, and hopefully DLC will shed a light on some of these past ages of the world, which seems to be a common theme. trend with FromSoftware DLC, and there just really are so many remnants of previous ages in this game, and I'd love to see a little bit more about what their cultures really were like. It kind of makes you resent just how all-encompassing the Ode Tree became. So many of these cultures have been lost, and I guess that's how a lot of characters in game feel as well. They feel upset by that, and knowing this fact helps you understand why so many of these characters are okay with burning down the Ode Tree. They're totally fine with that. And this brings us to our next boss, because in the act of burning down the Ode Tree, you release a slew of ulcerated tree spirits from it. These spirits lie suffering beneath the ash until you come along. But of course, you fight many of these tree spirits across the lands between, even before the endgame. There's an ulcerated tree spirit at the husk of this minor Ode Tree, there's a bunch in Catacomb Dungeons, by Great Tree Roots, there's even one at the husk of the Helic Tree. There's a lot of these. Some might even say there's too many of these bosses. I think they're the worst boss in Elden Ring. But anyway, understanding their lore might make it a bit more palatable. So while these creatures fight near the trees, I don't think they're defending them. Rather, I kind of think they're this corrupted byproduct of dead or dying trees. We know that one of the new purposes of the Ode Tree is to accept spirits and allow them to live on. And it's almost like these ulcerated spirits are this horrific failure of that process. One of Miyazaki's favorite themes in these games is the idea that life is not supposed to be eternal. And I think these spirits are a physical manifestation of stagnation and decay. They're this product of an age of an Ode Tree that really should have ended a long time ago. Most tree spirits drop golden seeds, which are also found at the base of smaller illusory trees. And they read, when the Elden Ring was shattered, these seeds flew from the Ode Tree, scattering across the various lands, as if life itself knew that its end had come. A talisman also goes on to say, the Ode Tree was once perfect and eternal, and thus it was believed that Ode Tree seeds could not exist. This was back when there was an Age of Plenty, when blessings literally dripped from the boughs of the Ode Tree like sap. And the Ode Tree's warm light healed those who bathed in its rays. The Ode Tree flourished with abundance, yet it was only for a fleeting moment. Such is the course of all life. Then the leaves began to fall, and as you know from the introduction and the endings, the fallen leaves tell a story. The story is that the Ode Tree was withering. Scattered across the lands between are minor Ode Trees, where you go to collect crystal tears. Basins were placed at the feet of minor Ode Trees in order to collect these tears. Though in some cases, these tears are dropped by Ode Tree avatars instead. When the Elden Ring was shattered, the avatars emerged, wielding ceremonial staffs that depict the Ode Tree in its historic radiance. These creatures are the will of the dying Ode Tree, made manifest, I think. They are literally part tree, after all, and they fight desperately to protect the minor Ode Trees, which are the offspring of the withering Ode Tree itself. Some avatars placed in Caelid and Michaela's Haleak Tree are rotten avatars, and they even have this uniquely designed staff that festers with rot, just as they do. Remember that Haleak Tree is also an emulation of the Ode Tree, so it makes sense that it has its own avatars as well. And they fight on, because to many of these creatures, any Ode Tree, whether it's minor, or a copy, or doomed, is something worth protecting.

      "[Doc 7: The Lore of Elden Ring is Eternal]\n",
      "I think everyone had this moment in Elden Ring. You find a building hidden in the forest of Limgrave's Mistwood, and the door mysteriously opens of its own volition to reveal an elevator down that just keeps going and going on and on until you forget that you're even underground. The cavernous roof is now so far above that it might as well be a false night sky, and the world below has life, light, and a culture of its own. But what's interesting about the environment down here is that it's actually a fusion of cultures. There are the dynastic remains infested with claymen, and then there's the ancestral grounds brimming with wildlife. But built amidst it all, between the ruins, beyond the ancestral grounds, and even hanging from the ceilings, are the incredible eternal cities inhabited by the Nox. For now, think of the Nox as just these enemies, the monks, swordstresses, and knight-maidens of the eternal cities. The word Nox means knight in Latin. Some of you might remember this from the phrase Verio Nox in Dark Souls, which was commonly held to mean fear the night. This theme has carried over to Elden Ring, where fear and respect for the knight is conveyed by characters like Ranni, who seek to usher in an age of stars. Ranni's voice, echoed by the Nox, says, \"...Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond, into fear, doubt, and loneliness.\" And just like the Age of Dark in Dark Souls, the coming Age of Stars is presented as a bit of an inevitability in Elden Ring. Or, at least it might have been, were it not for Starscourge Redan, who locked the stars out of motion and fettered the fate once writ in the night sky on behalf of the Golden Order. Again, this is just like in Dark Souls, where the coming Age of Dark was stolen from mankind by a greater power. Yet, even now, the Age of Stars continues to be championed by a people called the Nox, except now, the Nox have been banished to the underground, and here, they live in this state of eternal anticipation, just endlessly waiting for a fate that has been taken away from them. We're never explicitly told which act it was that led to the Nox's banishment, but my best guess is that it has to do with this, the Fingerslayer Blade, which we loot beneath the Giant's Throne in Nocron. A part of its description reads, So, what was the nature of the Nox's High Treason, then? Well, this is a Fingerslayer Blade, one that is able to harm the Greater Will and its vassals. This blade is drenched in blood and proof of High Treason, so it seems like the weapon was successfully used, but we can only really speculate on which pair of two fingers this blade might have been used on. Of course, it might have just been High Treason to create this blade in the first place. This weapon is said to be born of a corpse, so let's take a closer look at its icon. Doing so reveals a spine running up the blade and two arms that form the hilt. So clearly this weapon is born of a corpse, but it's not the only weapon in game that's like this. Remember that moment at the end of the game where the Elden Beast reaches into the ground and pulls a sword from Radagon's corpse? That is the Sacred Relic Sword, and it too is a spined spiral blade with a human forming the hilt. So to some in this item's description, this weapon represents the end of an age, and to others, the beginning. Now, I kind of doubt that the Fingerslayer Blade is made from a corpse that's as powerful as Radagon, just because it seems so much smaller, broken, and limp. But regardless, it clearly was an attempt to bring about the end of one age and the beginning of another, just so the Fingerslayer Blade can only be wielded by Ranni, who needs the weapon to claim her fate and achieve her ending. But this can only happen when you defeat Radan and unlock the fate in the night sky, because doing so sets free a star from the cosmos which crashes into Limgrave, revealing the path to Nokhron, the Eternal City, where the Fingerslayer Blade lies hidden. There are multiple Eternal Cities that are spread widely across the lands between, and located deep beneath the earth. First, we have the city of Nokhron, that lies beneath Limgrave. The entrance to this city is torn open by Radan's meteorite when we explore it, so all of the foremost buildings are ruined, but they form the path leading to this undisturbed, multi-layered city that's sort of tucked behind the dynastic remains and the ancestral environs that were built here long before. Then, there's Nokhron's twin, the city of Noxtella, which is located beneath Leonia. I think most people would have got their first hint of this city when they wound up in the Ainzul river, fighting the dragonkin soldier of Noxtella, but the true city is further up from here, stretching out between long sections of ant-infested tunnels. Here, the Nox have actually learned how to ride these ants, though the ants will happily turn on them if given the chance. But there's a third city, a completely devastated, nameless city located beneath Leyndell, which is a place we'll have to talk about a little bit later in this video. These three cities just have incredible architecture. I love Nokhron's massive inverted towers, and it's cool how Noxtella's shining city is built right into this low-hanging, false night sky. Now, the game isn't really clear on whether these cities existed before the Nox's banishment underground, or if they were built afterwards. However, I'm inclined to think that they actually existed before their banishment. Take the Fingerslayer Blade's description, for instance. This weapon is the most likely reason for the Nox's banishment, and it lays the high treason at the feet of the Eternal City. It doesn't blame the Nox, who would have existed above ground at some point. It blames the Eternal City. But regardless, while they at least might have already had these well-developed cities down here, their banishment was still a brutal punishment, because the Nox would have been cut off from the true night sky, which was a core part of their culture. As some small comfort, I speculate that they created these false night skies, which are made of suspended white fragments. This they accept, as they wait for the Age of Stars to begin. In order to learn more about these cities, though, I'd like to look at some datamined information. Of course, you have to take this with a grain of salt, but in version 1.0 of Elden Ring, the Eternal City buildings are frequently listed as Marika's ruins, and the Eternal City pavilions are Marika's pavilions. What's more, the Nox themselves are actually called Marika's descendants. This obviously has pretty huge implications, so let's try to break down Marika's ancestry and see if we can arrive at the Nox. So, Marika herself is of the Numen race, who, according to the character creation screen, are supposed descendants of denizens of another world. The only other supposed Numen in-game are the Blackknife Assassins, who, according to their silver armor, were all women and rumored to be Numen, who had close ties with Marika herself. And we have proof that these Numen Blackknives were tied to the Eternal Cities. They say the Assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City. So, if we take Roger at his word, then it seems like Numen are indeed tied up with the genealogy of the Eternal City, and that Marika herself is likely one of the Nox's ancestors. You could go as far as to say that Marika is actually from an Eternal City, too. She is called the Eternal, after all, but again, remember this is datamined information that we're not really supposed to know. But, at any rate, while the Nox might be descended from the Numen, I think enough time has passed that most Nox aren't really considered Numen anymore. If anything, they're now more akin to the Nightfolk, which is actually another descendancy you can choose for your tarnished in the character creator. Nightfolk and Nox share similarly hued skin, and Nightfolk are a race that were said to bleed silver long ago. So let's finally actually talk about the Nox Monks, the Priestesses, the Nightmaidens, and the silver that they wield. The Monks of the Eternal Cities are all men, and they fight with flowing weapons of liquid metal. So, too, do the Swordstresses, a female cast of the Nox, who are agile warriors and serve as the personal guards of the Nightmaidens. The Nightmaidens themselves are said to be of the highest clerical rank, and it's definitely interesting that a group of maidens would be of the highest clerical rank. It's almost as if the Nightmaidens exist as a sort of parallel to the Kindling Maidens of the Two Fingers, who serve the Tarnished so that they might become Lord. Because remember, a core part of the Nox culture is also about searching for a Lord to serve. Except unlike the title, Elden Lord, the Nox are waiting for a Lord of Night. In a way, this Lord of Night is almost an imitation of the Elden Lord, which would make sense because the Nox are extremely well-versed in the art of imitation. So let's talk about that. I think I speak for a lot of us here when I say that a core part of so many of our late game playthroughs were the Mimic Tear Spirit Ashes, which copied the form of their summoner. And from a lore point of view, the whole point of this Mimic Tear is actually to mimic the Tarnished who might become the Elden Lord. Its description reads, Mimic Tears are a result of an attempt by the Eternal City to forge a Lord. However, the description also says that their mimicry does not extend to imitating the summoner's will. This makes it seem like Mimic Tears are this tool, right? They're something to be used to achieve the Eternal City's ends. So it's important to point out here that Mimic Tears are actually more accurately Silver Tears, and Silver Tears literally are tools because they're wielded by the Nox as weapons. The Nox Flowing Hammer and the Nox Flowing Sword are forged from the liquid metal of Silver Tears and tempered to hardness. This gives them the ability to extend, bend, and when wielded by the Nox, to drastically change their form into spiked shields and even giant hands. And what's kind of chilling to realize is that these weapons are actually living beings. This is all quite clearly inspired by ancient alchemical conceptions of Mercury or Quicksilver, which was this compound that was believed to be able to shift between liquid and solid states, as well as life and death. In-game, Silver Tears are called Formless Life, able to be reborn again and again into imitation. They are as much a substance as they are a living organism. And we see this in their multitude of forms. Silver Spheres, Trolls, and even Night Folk, to name but a few. There's even this entire cut quest line that would have had you bond with a Silver Mimic Tear called Asimi. In the cut dialogue files, this Mimic Tear claims to have grown a desire for life and knowledge and lordship, and she desires to share the throne with you. I think, and I know a lot of you guys did as well when I mentioned this last time, I think this would have gone a really long way towards making players relate to the story of the Nox, and it would have made them question the order of the Erd Tree even more. And after learning about this quest line, I can definitely see why Mimic Tears and artificial life might have been this enormous threat to the Erd Tree's authority. The Nox were, after all, messing with these crucial things that the Erd Tree had come to govern. They were messing with the powers of life, death, and rebirth. Of course, we know that death was sacrosanct to the Erd Tree during its age. As I discussed in my video on death, many ancient methods of death came to be abandoned or shunned in favor of returning to the Erd Tree's roots instead, through the process of Erd Tree burial. All the old ways of death were abandoned. And as for rebirth, well, the Erd Tree is never really explicitly said to be able to rebirth beings. I think a lot of people just assume that it's implied, but there is a bit of evidence. Many depictions of the Erd Tree actually show human forms growing along its branches, just as they show human forms being absorbed in death by its roots. And you can't forget that an entire great rune of the Elden Ring explicitly governs rebirth. This is Rinala's Amber Egg, and inside it is the Great Rune of the Unborn. In the end, Lady Rinala was left alone. Cradling the Amber Egg, Lord Radagon bequeathed her. Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite, the grim art of reincarnation. I think Muriel calls Rinala's reincarnation a grim act here, because reincarnation already has a bit of a history with the Nox in the Lands Between. And Rinala isn't the Erd Tree, so I can see how what she's doing might be a bit sacrilegious. She's even capable of using larval tears from the Eternal City. So Muriel, speaking as any follower of the Erd Tree would, understandably decries Rinala's rebirths as forbidden rites. And when I searched for this phrase, forbidden rites, in my dialogue spreadsheet, I stumbled upon cut dialogue from Thopps, who confirms that forbidden rites like this did indeed originate in the Eternal City. I don't think it's a coincidence that forbidden rites is the same phrase used for Rinala, and by Thopps as well. Oh, one more thing. Beware the Albinaurics, accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City. So, the Albinaurics. Albinaurics seem to be a reference to the ancient notions of artificial life, and that's something that's supported by the Albinaurics blood clot description, which calls them life forms made by human hands. According to the Albinaurics shield, Albinaurics are said to have been created from a primordial drop of dew, which, to me, evokes the Erd Tree's own imagery of dew, where drops of life dripped from the Erd Tree's branches. Sort of imitation in that way, to me. The ripple blade that is wielded by young Albinaurics echoes this, stating that ripples are thought to be at the origin of their species. Obviously, these are all references to liquid, and it suggests that Albinaurics are born of the same liquid silver that we just discussed. An older description of the blue silver set also confirms this, calling Albinaurics children of silver. And there are a few different types of Albinaurics that can be encountered in game. There are first generation Albinaurics, who have withered legs and are called the Albinaurics of old. And then there are second generation Albinaurics, who resemble frogs and are called the young Albinaurics. Let's discuss these first generation Albinaurics first. As far as enemy models go, there are the men, who are commonly the subject of torture and genocide, and then there are the women, who seem to have learned to defend themselves as Albinaurics wolfback archers. This is probably a good time to mention, this isn't the only example in this video where the women of the culture are far more dexterous than the men. All of the black knives are women, the nox swordstresses defend the knight maidens, who are of the highest rank. And if we're talking about rank, then Caria and its princesses as well are a prime example of that. Speaking of Caria, actually, Pidia is an example of an Albinaurics man that serves Caria. And other Albinaurics men in Caria have clearly learned glinstone sorcery, not to mention Loretta. But maybe that's the story for another time. Moving on to the second generation Albinaurics. As newer Albinaurics in the lands between, the formula for these artificial humans seems to have been improved, as they now have legs, which they put to comically good use, although Thopps in his cut dialogue does say that they've lost the use of their tongues. So they really haven't got the formula quite right. There's something also going on with their- heads, which FromSoftware themselves call dumpy and frog-like. You can even loot the albinoric mask, which is literally just their own face skinned in an act of malicious mockery. And I really shouldn't laugh, but it is kind of funny, admittedly, that even Elden Ring players are also guilty of genociding helpless albinorics. There's this site in Mogwin Palace where it's just firing away the best way to farm runes, and thousands of players just kill these albinorics over and over again. It's just the perfect example of gameplay matching lore. Anyway, with all of this terrible shit happening to albinorics, frankly, just for the sheer audacity of them simply existing, it's no surprise that they see Michaela's halig tree as a haven. But in talking about that, we're getting far away from the Eternal Cities, so let's get back to there. So, it appears the Eternal Cities weren't content with just birthing silveteers and albinorics, because the dragonkin too were born in the Eternal City. There are a tragic few you can fight down there, and unlike the real stone dragons up above, they knew no true sky, nor true lightning. It seems these dragonkin were created, I think, with the intent of achieving a sort of immortality, something that is suggested by the Dragonscale Blade, which is an ice lightning weapon that reads, a weapon made by sharpening a gravel stone scale, thought to be the source of ancient dragon immortality, into an unclouded blade. Alas, the dragonkin soldiers never attained immortality, and perished as decrepit, pale imitations of their skyborne kin. There's the word imitation again. Interestingly, just like the Fingerslayer Blade is this hidden treasure of the Eternal City that is capable of harming the greater will, ancient dragon smithing stones too are a hidden treasure of Faraam Azula, capable of creating weapons that can slay a god. So, like so many other things in this video, the dragonkin almost seem like they are imitations that were born with a malign purpose. But just like Rinala's children, and the first gen albinorics, these imperfect births only led to withered legs, and a pitiful existence. And now, we finally arrive at the third city, the nameless Eternal City, which is located deep beneath the Ood Tree, at the deep depths. It's lost its sky, its name, and even all traces of the Nox. I believe we know exactly what is to blame for all of this. Astel, Bastard of the Void, is responsible. According to Astel's remembrance, it is a malformed star, born in the lightless void far away. With all the force of a falling meteor, it seems, Astel destroyed an Eternal City, and took away their sky. Logically, this nameless Eternal City is that Eternal City he destroyed, since it's absolutely devastated, and it is missing its false night sky. And when the description says Astel took away their sky, I believe that's really literal. I think Astel really did take it away, far away. Because we don't fight Astel anywhere near the nameless Eternal City, we fight it way further south. Almost as if Astel ruined the nameless city, then flowed all the way down the Ainsil River to the south, past Noxtella, and into an enormous cavern, where it set up a suspiciously familiar night sky. The Eternal Darkness spell tells us that it's this manifestation of the despair around the ruin of the Eternal City, and the spell in question is essentially this black hole with a powerful gravitational force drawing everything into it. The Astel don't seem like these super sentient beings to me, so what if they were mere animals, just drawn towards a sort of black hole, or maybe towards another powerful gravitational force, like a moon? Which brings us back to the city of Noxtella. Exploring Noxtella's tallest towers rewards you with the legendary Moon of Noxtella talisman, a treasure of theirs that represents the lost black moon. This moon apparently was once the guide of countless stars, and might have served as a sort of artificial moon below ground. But tragically, it seems this black moon was shattered into pieces, because fragments of this moon can be found in memory stones, which have a really similar gameplay function to the talisman, granting you additional memory slots. These stones are rightfully treasured by sorcerers, and above ground towers evoking those of the Eternal City would be built to protect these precious artefacts. I'm not sure how these fragments were stolen from the city, though over in Nochron, there are examples of foreign forces making incursions into the city. These beings are members of the Company of the Fallen Hawk, a company of slaves that were ordered to explore the Eternal City. Logically, these soldiers are slaves of the Golden Order, but who were the Fallen Hawks before their enslavement? Well, there's this one little theory that I quite like, by user nocontribution15 on reddit, that suggests that these fallen hawks could have once been common soldiers of Stormvale Castle, because these soldiers once had hawk crest shields, and even a Stormhawk King, dating back to ancient times, back when there was a true storm in Stormvale. And so, as the theory goes, the crest for this company became that of an inverted hawk, symbolising their fall, and perhaps referencing the inverted towers of the Eternal City that they were doomed to explore. As for why they explore the city, the first thing that comes to mind is that they might have been sent here to look for the Fingerslayer Blade, which is the hidden treasure of Nochron, where the Fallen Hawks were sent, although this is mostly all just speculation. Whatever the case, it really helps to characterise these enemies for you. Otherwise, the only other observation we can make is that many of the Fallen Hawks can be found digging hopelessly in the ground, hands bloodied by their long efforts to this day. Torches are an important part of their design, and this reinforces the idea that they're here looking for something, to the point where the band's last embers were used up in their long search, and then they began to burn the bones of their fellows, acquiring the cold ghost flame. And with this new flame in hand, they became dwellers of the underground for all eternity. Like with the Fallen Hawks, there are some really open-ended parts to the stories of the Eternal Cities, some things that are curiosities to me, and I welcome you to try and answer them. For example, the giant thrones, with the giant Nox skeletons on them, they're almost a complete mystery, I think. The only place the game references these thrones are in the symbols for night sorceries, and bubble sorceries as well. Beyond that, they're clearly a central part of Nox culture, though we don't know what purpose these beings had. Below each one, though, you can loot Great Ghost Glove Ward, which were given in tribute to those who died the most glorious of deaths, in the hope their stories would become legend. So it seems the Nox not only venerated these beings with giant thrones, but that their spirits as well were considered to be heroic, for their deaths were glorious. Another curiosity is the distorted bodies that are found in the Eternal Cities. These erupt from the ground, and many buildings as well, of the Nox. Are these the inhabitants of the city? Are their deaths related to the giants? What are these? And finally, there are the gargoyles that are found in the nameless Eternal Cities, with misshapen, ruined bodies. None of these gargoyles have been mended, but those that are mended are mended with black corpse wax, and they serve Malacath, the Black Blade. Many of you will remember that two valiant gargoyles defend the path from Nocron to the Deeproot Depths, where the nameless Eternal City is. Interestingly, it's a coffin that takes you up there, suspended on a golden script. This golden script reminds me of the description of the Cipher Parter, which reads, The furtive inscription appears to hang in the air, the language of light spoken by the two fingers. It makes sense that the two fingers would be aligned with these gargoyles that serve Malacath, and maybe some power of the two fingers is what takes you up to the nameless Eternal City in this coffin. Speaking of coffins, there's another coffin that you ride down from the Grand Cloister to Astel's Lair, and there are a ton of coffins found in the Eternal Cities in general. Beyond being some absurd method of transport, perhaps sending remains along the river was some sort of burial rite? At any rate, many of these coffins have been waylaid along the Ainsel River Tunnels, where ants feast upon the remains. And there's something fascinating going on with the ants as well. A lot of these have these enormous abdomens. These ants in particular are based off honeypot ants, which essentially function in nature as these living sources of food storage for the colony. And the Elden Ring variant drop one of the most valuable runes in the Lands Between. They drop a Newman's rune, which makes a lot of sense because these ants are feasting upon corpses, and we did speculate earlier that Newman are indelibly tied to the Eternal Cities. I could speculate further, but again, I'd welcome your thoughts on these curiosities. Exploring the Lands Between in the modern era, it's clear that the Eternal Cities have had this significant cultural impact upon many things that we find above ground. You can take the Walking Mausoleums, for example. These have really explicit Eternal City architecture, which is something that you can't help but notice when you see one of them wandering down in the nameless Eternal City. These mausoleums, it seems, were appropriated from the Eternal Cities to house the remains of soulless demigods of the Golden Order, something that suddenly became very necessary to do after Godwin's death. And this tracks because the Eternal Cities do have a bit of a history with spirits. We mentioned earlier that they entomb their heroic spirits with legendary Glovewort, but even the rebirth monuments above ground that you need to summon spirits look kind of like Eternal City constructs. So I speculate that these might have been pioneered by the Nox, who, even if they didn't use these to summon spirits, they definitely might have used them to summon puppets, because puppetry is an invention of the Eternal Cities. To create a puppet of someone, you need them to drink a potion made of Starlight Shards, which are a prized item that was once used in the Eternal City as an ingredient in intoxicating draughts. Starlight Shards are used for this because the stars command people's fates, and even the fates of the demigods, and so they can be used in potions given to create puppets with commanded fates. We know of two such puppets from the Eternal City, the Night Maiden and Swordstress puppets, who became puppets of their own volition. So keen were they, it seems, to serve the Eternal Cities. But when you look at all the puppet summons that you can get in Elden Ring, these two, the Night Maiden and the Swordstress of the Nox, these two are a bit of a special case, because most puppets we find are actually controlled against their will, and are extremely unwilling to serve their masters. An excellent example of this are the puppets that are controlled by Celibus, or should I say Pidia, who turn on him immediately when they're given the chance. These puppets are Knights of the Cuckoo, a faction that are explicitly aligned against Caria, and yet these knights are forced to fight on Caria's behalf, here in Caria, all the same. Carians also seem to have appropriated a lot of the tools of the Eternal Cities, like puppetry, and inverted towers as well, which is only natural considering how much they actually have in common with the Eternal Cities. Carians are descended from astrologers, who also venerated the night sky. Another example of an invention of the Eternal Cities that the Carians use is found at the Church of Vows, which features a Nox statue taken straight out of the Eternal Cities. Here at the Church, Radagon famously repented his territorial aggressions, and cleansed himself with Celestial Dew. Celestial Dew is another draft of the Eternal Cities. It's called a Night Tear, which reverses all antagonizations and moves fate backwards, in a sense, to a time or a feeling before those antagonizations took place. And eventually, faraway descendants of the Eternal would finally be found above ground as well. This is in Celia, within Caelid. Gowri calls Celians descendants of the Eternal, and in addition to having one of those signature thrones at the center of the city, there's also a couple of Nox bosses here. And finally, Celians were famed for their Knight class of sorceries, which their assassins made good use of. The Celians were also really proficient at turning invisible, which is an art that the Black Knives used, since they are, after all, Scions of the Eternal Cities. And it's just amazing how it all overlaps in the end. And in the end, another group would seek inroads to Nocron. This is when we play the game. These were Iji, Blythe, and Ranni. Ranni is a character that inherits a lot of the Nox's legacy. She becomes the final chapter in a story that they started to tell so, so long ago, prepare to cry, because I can't wait to cover her story properly, as it deserves.

It made Artyom shudder to imagine the tunnel beyond the 700th meter. It was horrifying just to think about it. No one had the guts to go beyond the 700th meter to the north. Patrols had made it to the 500th, and having illuminated the boundary post with the spotlight on the trolley and convinced themselves that no scum had crossed it, they hastily returned. Even the scouts, big guys, former marines, would stop at the 680th meter. They'd turn their burning cigarettes into their cupped palms, and stand stock still, clinging to their night vision instruments. And then they'd slowly, quietly head back, without taking their eyes off the tunnel, and never turning their backs to it. The narrator for this title is really good, and they really nail the Russian accents and just the voice acting as well for your immersion. New members can listen to Audible free for 30 days.

      "[Doc 8: The Lore of Elden Ring's Cosmic Sorcerers]\n",
      "Long ago, an astrologer looked to the sky and found something called the primeval current in the stars above. Then, miraculously, what they saw in the cosmos actually manifested in reality, and the very amber of the stars rained down on the lands between. This glintstone of the cosmos would go on to inspire those that studied it. But there was also a darkness up there between the stars, and what some saw would break their minds and inspire a fate that was worse than death. This is the story of Elden Ring's cosmic sorcery, a force that would define an entire era of life in the lands between. It all began with the Founding Reign of Stars, a legendary sorcery that was the founding glintstone sorcery. You might have missed this spell in your playthrough, but it's located here, hidden along an illusory path leading to the heretical rise within the mountaintops of the Giants. Its description reveals that it is the eldest primeval sorcery, said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer. Now, we don't know who this astrologer was, but we know they were not alone, for it was here, in these icy peaks closest to the sky, that the astrologists who preceded the sorcerers established themselves, and with ancient tools of astronomy, they looked at the cosmos above and read fate in the stars. But this was more than mere stargazing. The stars quite literally govern fates in Elden Ring. We learn this from the starlight shards and amber starlight items. The former is a pale blue shard, it's what remains of a passing flash of starlight, and the latter is the same, except it has a pale amber glow, and it tells of the belief that if the stars command our fates, then amber-hued stars must command the fates of the gods. During Selavus's questline, the blue starlight shards are distilled into this blue tonic, which can be given to other NPCs to turn them into summonable puppets. You are quite literally using starlight to forcibly control and take away their fates when you do this. These exact same intoxicating draughts had historically been used in the Eternal City, as is exemplified by the Night Maiden and Swordstress puppets, who actually chose this controlled fate for themselves, presumably so that they could better serve the needs of the Eternal City. You can learn more about that in this video, where we discuss the Eternal City in its entirety. But the Nox of the Eternal City weren't the only ones that were drawing power from the stars in this way. The Royal House of Caria, too, drew great power from astrology. The telescope item, for example, is actually a smaller part of a larger astrological tool that was once used by members of the Carian royal family for their own brand of Carian astrology that revolved around Rinala and the full moon rather than the stars. But to most, the moon was not considered equal to the stars, and it was actually the stars that most would draw upon for their sorcery. These sorcerers would come together at Ryalucaria, a place of learning that institutionalized the practice of glintstone sorcery. And this is a little triumvirate of three factions. There's the Nox and their descendants, there's the Carians, and there's the sorcerers of Ryalucaria, who all trace their origins back to astrology. These factions overlap at times, they interact and clash, and their shared history is fascinating and complicated, but it all comes back to the cosmos in the end. But let's return once again to the founding reign of stars, which tells us that the glimpse of the primeval current that the ancient astrologists saw became a reality, and the stars' amber rained down on this land. But what exactly is the primeval current? Well, let's break down the term. The word current means it's a moving flow or torrent, and the word primeval means that this torrential flow likely existed from the very beginning of time. And thanks to the description for Comet Azure, we know that the primeval current is a distant starry expanse, something that is visually similar to the torrential comet generated from this spell. But what's truly amazing about this cosmic force is that somehow this ancient astrologer managed to manifest a rain of stars upon the earth merely after glimpsing it in the primeval current of the cosmos far away. And I speculate that starlight shards are actually another example of this phenomenon. The description reveals that these are what remains of a passing flash of starlight, and we exclusively loot these at the foot of giant stone astrolabes, which are these ancient stargazing tools. Thus, rather than being a piece of star that has fallen to the ground, I think these might be a byproduct of the act of looking up at the stars. Why else would we loot them here? And so, in this same manner, first established with these starlight shards and then the founding rain of stars, glinstone sorcerers would go on to replicate this phenomenon, using their powers of comprehension to conceive of new cosmic elements that could be manifested in reality. Or put another way, they formulated spells that let them throw giant rocks at each other, and it was a huge hit with everyone. But among these glinstone sorcerers were some who wished to truly understand the mysteries of the primeval current, no matter the cost. These were sorcerers like Lusat and Zuo, who would literally become crystal in order to sync up with and better understand these powers of the cosmos. And then there was Selen, the graven witch who threw all ethics to the wind and wished to see humanity ascend no matter the cost. And make no mistake, the stars are alive, in a sense. Look at Estelle, for example. This is a malformed star, but a star nonetheless, birthed from a void, or so it is said. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Most sorcerers, it seems, would just be content with merely manifesting cosmic power, and so they would embed a piece of physical glinstone into a staff and then use that glinstone as a sort of catalyst for the stars above. And since glinstone was needed to channel spells, and since sorcerers needed glinstone to study, I think having access to physical glinstone would have been a really important thing. And luckily for the sorcerers, glinstone, being sourced from meteors and comets, had fallen to the lands between before. So these valuable crystals were mined and put to great use. And so, atop and amidst enormous quantities of glinstone, in the lakes of Leonia, a place of learning was built. An institution known as the Ryalucaria Academy. Sorcerers, as a whole, were powerful. They could read fate in the stars, fire cosmic projectiles at their enemies, and potentially even command the fates of others. So, naturally, there needed to be an institution for their power. A place of learning, but also a place of hierarchy, and even governance, where rules about sorcery could be debated and enforced. When you journeyed through Ryalucaria, you would have collected these symbols of their institution. These are stone masks called glinstone crowns, and not just anyone is supposed to wear these crowns. They are a symbol of achievement, and they represent one's mastery of a certain conspectus or school of learning within the Academy. They also make a good weapon, if all else fails. But why was this design specifically chosen as a symbol of achievement? Well, according to many item descriptions, there isn't just life in stone, but there is a wisdom contained in stone as well. So, their masks were crafted with stone and set with glinstone. The glinstone is typically set upon the eyes and or the brain, a tradition that I speculate originated with the sorcerer Azur, who was one of the first, if not the first, glinstone sorcerer. His blue-green glinstone crown was set with crystals and eventually replaced his own brain and skull altogether, which enhanced his powers by helping him catalyze with glinstone, though it clearly came at great physical cost. And I speculate that this crown eventually replaced his own brain and skull because glinstone kind of does that. It corrodes, it consumes. We see its effects best on other creatures like the dragon Smurug, who was a devourer of sorcerers with a body that became corroded over time by their glinstones, thanks to that strict sorcerer diet. But as with Azur, this corrosion did not come without benefits, and he now breathes a powerful glinstone breath. The sorcerer Azur was an early sorcerer of the primeval current, but he wasn't the only one. There was also the sorcerer Lusat, who experienced a similar glinstone convergence of body and mind. Together, these masters of sorcery each glimpsed a part of the primeval current, and from what I gather, the primeval current seems like the sort of thing that can only really be glimpsed once before it either breaks or terrifies the viewer. Azur and Lusat only have one primeval current spell each, after all. For instance, when Lusat glimpsed into the primeval current, he conceived of the spell Stars of Ruin as he beheld the final moments of a great star cluster, and upon seeing it, he too was broken. And when Azur glimpsed into the primeval current, he saw darkness and conceived of the spell Comet Azur, but was left both bewitched and fearful of the abyss. Both Azur and Lusat clearly had a prominent role at the academy, but Azur specifically was the first founding glinstone sorcerer to have an impact upon Raya Lucaria, for there is a line of research called the Karolos Conspectus. Dubbed the oldest of the academy's lineages of study, begat by the sorcerer Azur. Sorcerers who follow in his footsteps by studying this conspectus pursue the mysteries of comets, leading to new kinds of comet sorceries like Glinstone Comet Shard and Shard Spiral. Each conspectus appears to be named after a founding individual. These stone crowns are designed after actual people. After all, people you can see in the flesh upon their matching portraits in the academy. So even though the Karolos Conspectus follow the path began by the sorcerer Azur, their conspectus of learning must have been sort of formalized by someone named Karolos. But as time went on, more conspectuses needed to be created as new lines of inquiry were discovered. And so logically, the Olivinus Conspectus should have been the second to be created, for this line of research is also concerned with the study of meteors in the primeval current, except this conspectus began with the sorcerer Lusat. Their spells study clusters of stars, with lesser spells like Glinstone Stars and Star Shower, all echoing the great Stars of Ruin spell that originally broke Master Lusat. Lusat and Azur were true masters at the academy, after all. They were actually dubbed Grandmasters, specifically, with special robes that reflected that, and it seems like no one ever went on to achieve such a rank or sacrifice as much as they did. And they sacrificed a lot. They can barely even move anymore. And when Selen talks about them, she talks about their bodies rather than a traditionally living person. Perhaps they've actually ascended to a higher plane of existence? That might explain why they weren't really around anymore to form their own conspectuses, something that was left to Corollos and Olivinus and others instead. With such enigmatic founders, many dedicated themselves to the study of Glinstone, taking vows of virtue and austerity. In return, they received the deep blue robe of Raya Lucaria, and were able to study on its grounds. Some nobles of Leyndell were even permitted to study here, clearly, though their meager accomplishments never warranted them earning a stone crown. And fittingly, you only see them casting Glinstone Pebble in-game. To assist in their learning, a powerful spellcaster would often go and cast a spell called Terra Magica from the tallest belfry of the academy. This sigil would be cast with such strength and allow for such a vivid experience of spellcasting success that it turned many a fledgling into a true sorcerer in a flash of understanding. But not all learning took place at the academy. In fact, a couple of signature spells were specifically given to those who departed from the academy to embark on journeys. Starlight is a spell that guides such sorcerers in dark places, and it reads, even during the blackest nights, sojourns underground, or imprisonment in jail, the stars are never far from a sorcerer's side. And then there was Glinstone Arc, which would allow these fledgling sorcerers to cleave through the ranks of the fools that would outnumber them on their journeys. Such journeys were encouraged by the academy. There was even a conspectus for this practice called the Hyrodus Conspectus, with a crown that was granted to scholars who engaged in nomadic study away from the academy. In-game, this crown is worn by errant sorcerer Wilhelm, who fights with night sorceries and wields the Staff of Loss, which enhances night sorceries. This staff doesn't even have a Glinstone embedded in its tip, and supposedly it can only cast night sorceries as a result. That's how important asceticism was to some sorcerers, and they believed that it was a powerful path towards discovery. This conspectus also seemed to see value in depriving the senses. The crown of Hyrodus is blindfolded, after all. We see this same practice of veiling the eyes down in the Eternal City as well, and the Nox's descendants were of course accomplished practitioners of night sorceries, which seemed to be thematically tied to this blindfolded, ascetic embrace of the void. Moving on though, this habit of sending fledgling sorcerers away must have posed a bit of a problem, however, as when war broke out in the Lands Between, Raya Lucaria would close and seal its gates, preventing access to most, including its journeying fledgling sorcerers. The only way to get back inside was to use a Glinstone key to activate the warp magic within the seals. These keys only seem to belong to accomplished sorcerers, and they remember their users, meaning that thieves or blundstones like Thopps could not get inside. In the current age, Thopps mentions that the Academy closed its gates after declaring that they wouldn't interfere with the shattering. Now, this suggests to me that the Academy might have had a bit of a habit of striving for a sort of neutrality or indifference in world affairs. Indeed, they had developed an entire conspectus who sought power in order to quell conflict. These were the battle mages of the Haima Conspectus, who wielded stone clubs and spells of cannon and gavel. A gavel is commonly used as a symbol of judgment, but rather than interfering with outside affairs, I believe the Haima Conspectus mainly functioned as the Academy's judiciary. Their crown is even blindfolded, which is widely regarded in the real world as a symbol of unbiased justice. And with their preparedness for combat, the Haima Conspectus were cited as being the only ones who dared to venture outside whenever war had broken out. And just like the blindfolded members of the Hyrodus Conspectus, the battle mages of Haima believed that seclusion was no way to foster discovery, and instead believed that it was only a convenient form of escape. That said, we do find sorcerers of other conspectuses outside the Academy as well, though you can sort of infer that they're a bit wary to be away from home, because they're often accompanied by marionettes. The marionettes are dolls, constructs that were crafted and animated by the sorcerers who are their masters. There are a couple of variants. There's an avian variant with curved swords that can fly and throw fire pots, and then there's the typical marionettes with spiked spears, short swords, and short bows. Lots of short bows. These will commonly drop down upon you in ambush, and while they like to go a bit ballistic, they do act as crudely effective support for a ton of the sorcerers that you'll meet in game. You'll even find a few of these down in the Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel, where glintstone miners are hard at work extracting glintstone and ore. These miners don't use conventional tools, though. Instead, they mine with a digger's staff, embedded with a glintstone, casting spells such as Shatter Earth or Rock Blaster. A fascinating little detail here, though, is that these mining spells carried enormous stigma at the Academy, because they marked their user as a failed scholar, perhaps as someone who had to turn to menial labor, lacking the intelligence to pursue the complex mysteries of the cosmos. Indeed, the Overseers attack by crushing scraps of glintstone, rather than with any advanced sorceries. At the end of the Crystal Tunnel is a Crystallian, an inorganic being that was hewn from crystal long ago. But these are more than mere constructs. They are ancient, and even possess a faint sort of intellect dubbed the Wisdom of the Stone. Long ago, they even made a Concord, or an agreement with the Carian royal family. We don't know the nature of this agreement, but some can be found chilling upon the Moonlight Altar, allowed to stay in close proximity to their crystals, perhaps. And for their part, we do know that the Crystallians did teach the Carians a spell called Magic Downpour to mark the occasion. And Raya Lucaria sought kinship with these beings as well, for they are close to the ideals of the primeval current, and so are revered guests of the sorcerers. The best example of this might be down in the dimly lit Academy Crystal Cave, underneath Raya Lucaria. A crystal cave that is not mined, perhaps out of respect for the Crystallian duo at the end of the tunnel. There are even living quarters down here, and I suspect these belong to a group of sorcerers called the Crystal Khadra, which was a group that was founded to research the Wisdom of Stone, possessed by the Crystallian. However, just like the primeval current, these sorcerers clearly don't have all the answers on these beings. They call them inscrucible, and note that they have but one clear purpose, and that is to safeguard their crystals until the end. Though, there is one theory on these beings, and it's that they are waiting, yearning for the return of their creator, who will carve for them new brethren. A few sorcerers down here near the Crystallian are in possession of the Twin Sage Helm, which marks them as members of the Twin Sage Conspectus. These were the elites of the Academy, permitted to study and excel in sorceries of all kinds, and I assume it was these members, these elite members, who would climb out of this cave, and cast the legendary Terra Magica, that would cover the entire Academy's grounds from this tall belfry that we mentioned earlier. But the Twin Sage Helm wasn't the only mark of a proficient scholar, there was also the Witch's Glintstone Crown, which was granted to a scholar who excelled in her studies, which also merited the title of Witch. And again, you can see most of these Conspectus portraits hanging in Dry Lucaria. For example, here is the Witch, the Twin Sage, Carolus, Olivinus, and all of these portraits are hung in the debate parlor of the Academy, where members would likely have engaged in argument in order to test, and help validate their ideas about sorcery. It's also where I assume they argued about whether certain things even should be allowed to be learned here, or whether certain members should be exiled, but we'll get to that shortly. Because first, the final Conspectus that we haven't yet mentioned is the Lazuli Conspectus. These sorcerers studied Lunar Sorceries, a quote-unquote heterodox pursuit, that views the moon as equal to the stars, with a robe colored in the hue of the full moon, which signifies their heresy. And of course, these sorceries include many signature spells of Caria. And so, we finally arrive at Caria. This is Carian Manor, and to the south are their stargazing grounds, both situated upon the western coast of Leonia, which, according to the map, has always been closely associated with Carian royalty. They have been around for a long time, a really long time. Specifically, Caria traces its roots all the way back to the ancient astrologers that existed alongside the Fire Giants. This is most apparent when you're looking at two items. First, the Sword of Night and Flame, which became a storied sword and treasure of Caria Manor. It was clearly crafted to commemorate the astrologers' early experiences with the Primeval Current, and their shared experiences with the Fire Giants as well. And the fact that Caria inherited this sword suggests that they traced their ancestry back to the time of this sword. And then there's the Stargazer Heirloom, which tells of the rise of Caria as a house of royalty through Rinala and her full moon. The young astrologer gazed at the night sky as she walked. She had always chased the stars every step of her journey. Then she met the full moon, and in time, the astrologer became a queen. This royal house continued this tradition of stargazing, and raised princesses and Carian knights to serve as their retainers. One of the foremost Carian knights was named Loretta. A woman we talked about recently in the video I did on the Eternal Cities, as it was rumoured that she was an Albenoric. Albenorics, as you may know if you watched that video, were widely despised in the Lands Between. Though Caria is one of the few factions that seems to be pretty friendly with them. Albenoric sorcerers are found all throughout Caria Manor, and one named Pidia is literally called a Carian servant, linking the Eternal Cities with Caria in an alliance perhaps, that might have allowed them to learn more about the stars from the Albenorics. At any rate, Rinala, with her full moon sorceries, was the champion of Caria. A prominent one too, apparently. It's no surprise when you look at the powerful characteristics of her full moon. It has immense gravity, and it eclipses all other magics. It lowers defences. It is enchanting. And Rinala used all of these traits to charm the Academy, to bewitch them, and become not just the Queen of Caria, but also the Master of Ryalucaria itself. And so, of course, here is her portrait, displayed most prominently in the Academy of Ryalucaria, right next to what many assume is a portrait of Selen. For if you unmask her in-game, then she actually looks very similar to this witch. Someone who was worthy of an entire conspectus, and apparently was the most promising sorceress in the history of the Academy. But even Selen, with all her promise, or perhaps because of her promise, would not be tolerated in the end. If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Ryalucaria. It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glinstone sorcery. The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. I want glinstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. For Selen to know so much about what she calls toothless pedantry, peddled by the Carian royal family, I assume she was a part of the Academy during Rinala's reign over it, and that it was Rinala's influence that finally led to the Academy's intolerance of primeval current research. And Selen wasn't the only one expelled from the Academy. The masters Azur and Lusat, two of the founding masters of glinstone sorcery, were at some point driven from the Academy as well. And it's easy to see why. The primeval current is dangerous. Lusat's mind was broken after watching a star cluster break apart. Azur saw a darkness in the primeval current, and was left fearful of its abyss. And imagine something so dangerous that just looking at it can damage your mind irreparably. In this way, the primeval current is almost Lovecraftian in its horror. We can't pin down the exact truth of why it terrifies, but we see its terrible effects on others, and are left to wonder. What's more, this cosmic current is primeval. It's one of the first, if not the first, thing to exist in the universe. And the fact that our cosmic origins might be terrifying really is kind of a bizarre and bewitching thought, right? I mean, I want to know what's in this current that's driving everybody insane. Although I will mention again we kind of know that at least creatures like Estelle are up there. And Estelle kind of is a signature horrific Lovecraftian monster, so yeah. At any rate, Raya Lucaria was an institution now, with power and influence in the lands between. And with these things, naturally, there would have come a need for self-preservation. And the biggest threat at this stage wouldn't have been external, it would have been internal. The biggest threat was probing the primeval current too deeply. And so, while primeval current research seems to still be okay as long as it's under the Carolus or Olivinus conspectus, a line was drawn, and the masters Azur and Lusat were eventually driven from the academy, as was Selen, the witch. When we first meet her, Selen states that glintstone sorcery is rooted in the study of the stars, and she laments that most sorcerers have forgotten that fact. She resents that the sorcerers took their power and then sort of turned a blind eye to deeper research in order to protect themselves. And it's kind of easy to empathize with her, and to see her as this underdog fighting for the truth against an enormous institution. Even Thopps thinks she's a good person in the end, but can you really blame Raya Lucaria for taking a stand when you see this? This is a school of graven mages, a mass of sorcerers fused together so that they might be fashioned into the seeds of stars. As the lore goes, this was apparently a valid line of research into the primeval current, and that in the name of this research, fellow sorcerers should be collected and fused together in a cluster to, I guess, create a star made of life. These creations were considered the nightmare of the academy, and rightfully so. They represented Selen's complete loyalty to the truth, no matter the cost, to her fellow man. Naturally, such a thing had to be forbidden. But then, you have to empathize with Selen a little bit and agree that it is a bit ironic that the exact line of inquiry that gave rise to the academy was the very thing that posed a threat to its existence in the end. Eventually, the academy would seek to rid itself of Caria's influence, but the Carian royal family had long prepared for the disloyalty of the academy. There's a reason why the Carian knight's shields are extremely magic resistant. There's a reason why there are many spells based on a policy of Carian retaliation, where magic can be absorbed and then turned back against its caster. There's a reason why their knights were specifically sworn to the moon, not the stars. Rennala, as a proficient astrologer, might have even foreseen the eventual disloyalty of the academy, although that's just speculation on my part. But before that, there was another war that would come first, a war against the champions of gold, which Caria was extremely prepared to face as well. The Order of the Erd Tree had conquered fire giants, the Storm Lords, and Caria and the academy were next, it seems. Led by Radagon, who we now know was a part of Marika, a great war began. But here, the Order of the Erd Tree actually met their match. Despite numbering fewer than 20, the Carian knights were a match for even the champions of gold in battle, and enchanted troll knights fought on Caria's side as well, called into service from an ancient oath made with Rennala back in her youth atop the mountaintops of the giants. And so, instead of weathering a stalemate, a truce was proposed between the two parties, and sealed in holy matrimony. And of course, we all know that Radagon is Marika, but no one else did. And so, secrecy was of the utmost importance to Radagon, and he imposed this need upon his newly acquired vassals. These are the Carian Preceptors, essentially professors of sorcery who serve the Carian royals. They wear these blue robes, embroidered with cosmic designs, which is a reference to Caria's astrological heritage, surely. But when Radagon married Rennala, he ordered the Carian Preceptors to wear an additional piece of attire, a mask with the mouth sewn shut with gold thread, in that signature crisscross pattern that is emblematic of Radagon, to make it clear that all their matters were to be kept strictly private. For of course, Radagon was hiding something, that might be able to be seen if anyone looked at him too closely. Indeed, this desire for secrecy was well-founded, for someone did look at him too closely during this time. A sculptor, who secretly rendered this dichotomy between Radagon and Marika into his work. But no one else discovered Marika Radagon's secret, not until we came along. And long before that, Radagon would leave Rennala, and her heart would go along with him. And it was then, that those at the Academy realised, that Rennala was no champion after all. When we see her, we realise that she was likely left quite witless and innate after this loss of Radagon, and so it was no surprise that the Academy took this chance to rebel against the Carian Royals. With Rennala essentially held hostage and safely locked in their grand library, the Academy went to war with Caria, focusing their assault upon Caria Manor, for that is where a siege, commemorated by this graveyard of swords, took place. The enchanted soldiers who fought on behalf of the Academy were named the Knights of the Cuckoo. Wearing red and blue surcoats that depict their namesake, and carrying shields that boasted high magic damage negation, they were explicitly purposed as mage hunters, and have been quoted as stating, our enemy is none other than Caria itself. They also throw albinoric pots, which reference the torture of albinorics, and the hatred of albinorics that the Cuckoos have. And again, the albinorics are found throughout all Caria, so these Knights of the Cuckoo were fighting against some true enemies here. But despite some of their descriptions saying that the Cuckoo Knights were sworn to the Academy, I think that's actually just wishful thinking by Raya Lucaria. The scholars' armament and shield spells, for example, were actually spells that were, quote-unquote, taught to the Knights of the Cuckoo as payment for their contract. So they were getting paid to fight, and learning these low-intellect spells suited them because they were not proficient sorcerers. For example, instead of casting spells, they would crush broken clumps of glintstone, dubbed faux-sorceries or fake-sorceries by the Academy. But most telling about their loyalty is the Cuckoo Knight armor, which says its left breast is emblazoned with a peering cuckoo, whence came their name, which straight-up admits that perhaps the bird's shrewd gaze is an expression of their refusal to be mere servants of the Academy. And in the end, the Knights of the Cuckoo failed pretty hard. They were not only defeated in the siege of Caria Manor, but they were turned into puppets there, and many now fight on Caria's behalf. We get an idea of how much they must resent this when they somehow break free and confront Pidia, a carrion, an albinoric, and a mage. Three things that they absolutely hate. But unfortunately, guys, that's where I have to leave things for now. There's an entire summary I also wanted to do about Celia, the town of sorcery as well, but honestly, I feel like Celia is very difficult to speculate on and puzzle out. So considering how long that would take to put into words, I think it might have to wait until another video. But please subscribe, because I will talk about it eventually, and I think I'll also give Selen her own Prepare to Cry episode as well. Hers is going to be amazing. There's some good things ahead, as always. Special thanks to Quellag for reviewing this script, and of course to MissPap1 who did all of the incredible visuals in this video. He's a true master, and I'm lucky to be working with him. But I'll see you in the next one, guys. Thank you for watching.\n",

      "[Doc 9: The Lore of Elden Ring's Slumbering Demigod]\n",
      "Michaela is many things. A fundamentalist, the unalloyed, creator of the Heiligtree, Lord of the Eclipse, Saint Trina of the Cradle Song, and not just a demigod, but a fearsome Empyrean who has been captured, but is unresponsive for now. And after watching this video, I think you'll agree that Michaela is a topic that almost has to be explored further in some upcoming DLC, for how could they not be? Their character is surely too major, too foreshadowed, and too intriguing to just ignore. So, let's learn everything that there is to know. For starters, Michaela is the demigod child of Queen Marika and King Consort Radagon, who, as I'm sure you're well aware at this point, are the same being. You can learn more about the timeline of events from my other videos, but basically, after Radagon left Ranala, the academy told Radagon to go fuck himself, basically. But Radagon took that literally, and sired a third set of demigod children all on his own, the twins Michaela and Melania. These children appear to be represented by the butterfly items in the game, and the nascent appears to represent Michaela. Its description elaborates on his state of eternal childhood, stating that it appears as if it's just emerged from its cocoon for its entire life. Indeed, the word nascent means that something is just coming into existence, and beginning to display signs of future potential. And that nascence is eternal for Michaela, and I think that this eternal nascence is incredibly important for his character. For Michaela and Melania both seem to occupy different sides of the life and death cycle. That's not to say that Michaela represents life, and Melania represents death. Rather, it seems like both land somewhere in the middle of each process. Melania is constantly resisting her scarlet rot, and is in this perpetual state of dying, and Michaela is in this constant state of nascence. He is newly born, and showing an abundance of life and burgeoning potential. Special thanks to Quelaag for making this clear to me. So Michaela is nascent, but he's also abundant, and I think that's another extremely key word for him. For example, there's this cut weapon called the Abundance and Decay Twinblade, which symbolises the twins, and suggests that the twins were born from an inseparable fate, and hold the runes of both abundance and decay between them. Not to mention, the word abundance is also literally spoken by Michaela in his cut content, and thanks to a very recent discovery by Sekiro Doobie, we know this cut dialogue I'm about to voice is Michaela speaking. And here, he appears to be leading you towards a unique ending for the game, and he talks about his ability to make life flourish, stating, This is for thee, mine abundance, my drop of dew. Quench thy thirst throughout thy frame. Blossom and burgeon, time and again. Grow larger, stronger, until the day cometh, when thou canst share in my dream. Elden Ring, O Elden Ring, beget order most elegant from my tender reverie. And before I go on, I do want to say that Michaela talking about his abundance is cut content, and you shouldn't really take it as canon, but I think it does give us a deeper look at not only the powers that Michaela might have had, but also the world that he could create. He goes on to say, If thou covetest the throne, impress my vision upon thine heart. In the new world of thy making, all things will flourish, whether graceful or malign. And I love that final line, all things will flourish, whether graceful or malign, because Michaela isn't enforcing any real notions of good or evil here. Instead, in the new world of his making, he simply wants all things to flourish. And I feel like that is a very unique viewpoint for a character in a Souls game. Not to mention, Michaela is certainly one of the few beings that is capable of creating this new world. That's because he is an Empyrean. He is one of the very few who were candidates, chosen by the two fingers to succeed Queen Marika, and to become a god, to usher in a new age. Now we could go into an entire debate about why the twins are valid Empyreans, and why they were born afflicted, but honestly, that could almost be an entire video of its own. So for now, I'll just give the simple answer, which is that these twins were probably valid Empyreans because they have singular parentage from a god, but that this singular parentage was probably also responsible for their afflictions as well, due to the almost incestual implications of such a thing. Why do I feel like it was George RR Martin that wrote this part? Anyway, let's move into the early childhood years of Michaela's eternal childhood. Michaela's early years were clearly quite inspired by their father, Radagon, who fostered a bit of a fundamentalist streak in his prodigal son, and Michaela would go on to invent fundamentalist incantations of his own, dubbed Discus of Light and Triple Rings of Light, which he gave as gifts to his father. These gifts reveal that Radagon and Michaela had a good relationship, and Radagon must have been proud of his son, because these two spells do represent those two key fundamentals of the Golden Order, namely that there is a law of causality, which is a branching cause and effect that goes outwards, but also that there is a law of regression, that all things yearn eternally to converge once again. And in gratitude, Radagon counted with a gift of his own, showing Michaela Radagon's Rings of Light. These incantations would go on to become core fundamentalist spells, as they are true to those two concepts that form the basis of the Golden Order. But there is another aspect of Golden Order fundamentalism, and that is the persecution of those who live in death. Hunters of these undead would attempt to stamp them out with spells such as Order's Blade and Litany of Proper Death, which deal additional damage against those who live in death and prevent them from resurrecting. To recap, those who live in death exist because of Godwin the Golden, who was one of the early sons of Marika and Godfrey, who was eventually killed with a fragment of the Rune of Death, and then the Rune of Death would eventually spread its undeath throughout the lands between via Deathroot. And there is an entire debate that we could have here about whether the persecution of those who live in death is even true to the core principles of fundamentalism. Goldmask certainly doesn't seem to think so. In fact, according to the Order Healing spell, Goldmask laments the hunters of those who live in death, deeming them to be fanatics, who wanted nothing more than an absolute evil to contend with. And the reason I bring up this debate at all is because you could argue that Michaela was on the side of these fanatic hunters, as he created multiple weapons that were capable of effectively slaying those who live in death. For example, this is Golden Epitaph, and it is a sword that was made to commemorate the death of Godwin the Golden, first of the demigods to die. It is infused with the humble prayer of a young boy, and reads, Oh brother, Lord brother, please die a true death. So this weapon is an effective tool of killing those who live in death permanently. And clearly, the young boy who created it was Michaela. We can infer this because the sigil that appears when you use this blade's skill is the Halic Tree sigil. And once activated, this ability, called Last Rites, imbues the sword with a holy power that prevents those who live in death from reviving. But beyond this being a potential tool to slay those who live in death, is that this weapon points towards an early kinship between Michaela and Godwin. A relationship that might have made it all the more painful when Godwin's soul would perish, but his body would remain, spawning Deathroot. This is interesting, as it gives Michaela a legitimate emotional grievance against those who live in death. And it's almost a bit hypocritical, I think, for what I believe to be Michaela's character, as we previously established that he might have been this character who wants all life to flourish, but I guess that principle might not extend to those who live in death for him. This sword might not be the only representation of Michaela's relationship with Godwin. That relationship is potentially strengthened even more when we consider this statue, found in Alfail before the Halic Tree. It depicts a larger figure, who is clearly embracing the two Empyrean twins, Michaela and Melania. But then, who is this larger figure? It could be their parent, Marika or Radagon, but then it doesn't have their signature hair braid, and instead it has this long wavy hair. What's more, the statue asset is flat-chested, which appears to rule out Marika, at least. And after reading a good amount of debate online about this, I think it's a fair conclusion to say that this statue represents Godwin, who himself does seem to have long wavy hair. And this statue being enshrined here really tells a story. It's a story of two gifted but afflicted siblings who were supported by their older brother, but then they were left alone, as their older brother would become the first demigod to die. And this isn't the only statue in this location. Far more prominent in the area are these statues, which depict two siblings left alone after their brother died. There was one sibling, Michaela, who was forced to remain as a young child, and another, who grew up in great pain, eventually losing vision and limbs to rot and decay. These statues are everywhere in the Halic Tree, and they tell that sorrowful story. They are an early sign of Michaela's extreme empathy for his sister, and they foreshadow his desperate attempts to give her relief from her terrifying condition. And so, the young Michaela abandoned fundamentalism, for it could do nothing to treat Melania's accursed rot. This was the beginning of Unalloyed Gold. Unalloyed Gold So, what is unalloyed gold? Well, an alloy is something that's created when you combine metals, usually because you want to create a stronger compound, at the expense of its purity. So, if we were to view Marika's Golden Order as if it were a metal, which I think is something the lore wants you to do, considering the implications of the Tarnished and everything like that, then Marika's Golden Order would definitely be an alloyed metal. Just think of all the foreign powers that it's absorbed in the interest of strength. For example, Godfrey and his Crucible Knights were enlisted to devastate Marika's enemies. The Ancient Dragons were won over, and eventually became a part of Leyndell's forces. Even the House of the Erd Tree and the Moon were married at one point. Literally. After all, as Muriel puts it, all things can be conjoined under the Golden Order. So, I think Marika was definitely open to fusing factions and ideologies to an extent, as long as it made her treasured Golden Order alloy stronger. So, hopefully now you understand what I mean when I say that Michaela's gold is unalloyed. It is pure, it is untainted, and it is, perhaps, a singular ideology. And if you subscribed to the idea that the cut content is still representative of Michaela, then I would say that his ideology is what I had Michaela quote earlier, that in his new world, all things should be allowed to flourish, whether graceful or malign, and that that is his pure ideology. Though, of course, that is my speculation based on cut content as well, so please keep that in mind. But Michaela's unalloyed gold couldn't have just been this metaphysical concept of pure ideology, it was a physical material as well. For example, this is an unalloyed gold water lily, said to have been beloved by Michaela. This is a bewitching branch, blessed with an incantation of unalloyed gold. Unalloyed gold decorated the armor and shields of his soldiers, it was inserted into their weapons, and most importantly, perhaps, it was forged into a set of armor for his sister, Melania. Because remember, the whole reason Michaela embraced unalloyed gold in the first place, it seems, was because he thought that it could treat his sister's accursed rot, while fundamentalism could not. And he was right. For Melania's scarlet rot is no mere disease, it's literally the divine essence of an outer god, and Melania is its vessel that will one day bloom into a true goddess. But unalloyed gold is one of the few materials in the game that can ward away such meddling of the outer gods. Another example are the mirror helms, like the one that Eiji wears, which literally reflects the influence of the outer gods. Personally, I think the reason unalloyed gold inhibits the meddling of the outer gods is because it is a pure metal, and potentially a pure ideology. But if that's not enough reason for you, then Quelaag actually has a great video where she breaks down potential reasons at a chemical level. But at any rate, reasons aside, Michaela crafted needles of unalloyed gold, which could be inserted into the tortured flesh of one afflicted by rot to alleviate their suffering, and forestall the effects of the rot. And true to the needle's descriptions, the outer god of rot isn't the only one affected by this. Our character actually uses the final version of this unalloyed gold needle to subdue the outer god of frenzy, which is something you might want if you decided to be a terrible person and burn down the world. Anyway, when we first find Michaela's needle, it's been broken, snapped in half, and picked up by a commander at the very centre of the Scarlet Swamp. But once this needle has been prepared, we can give the golden needle to Millicent, proving that it does indeed work to forestall the rotting sickness, to remove pain and nightmares from the afflicted. It is, after all, lovingly crafted by Michaela himself. Well, well, this is a marvel indeed. The work of a true artisan, a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life. In crafting these needles, and pursuing unalloyed gold, Michaela is attempting to save his sister from her affliction. It seems like this objectively good deed, which is a rare sight in Elden Ring, especially for a demigod, whose strengths have been known to tip them towards madness. And that is what makes Michaela such a pure and likeable character in Elden Ring. So it's no wonder really that Melania venerated her brother. She is a character of undefeated prowess, and she's an Empyrean, no less. And yet, she dedicated her blade to Michaela, and Michaela alone, for she believes that he possesses the wisdom, the allure of a god, and that he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all. The story of their bond and duty to one another is legendary, and that's something that becomes quite clear when we explore Michaela's Heiligtree, and see these statues depicting their embrace all around. And if you were one of the many defiled outcasts in Elden Ring, you too might have felt inspired by this story, and you might have felt inclined to earn Michaela's favour, and make the long pilgrimage towards your salvation, towards the distant, divine Heiligtree, and its brace that was Michaela's domain. So first, what even is the Heiligtree? Well, it's pretty obvious that it's a sort of Oodtree. For one, Oodtree avatars have clearly emerged from it, which they only do in order to protect the Oodtree's own offspring. And then there's the Heiligtree knight armour, which confirms that the Heiligtree ultimately failed to grow into an Oodtree. And one thing I've been wondering is, when exactly was the Heiligtree planted then? If we knew when, then we might be able to guess at its purpose. Was it planted before or after the shattering of the Elden Ring? Because when the Elden Ring was shattered, golden seeds flew from the Oodtree, scattering across the various lands, as if life itself knew that its end had come. These seeds create these little illusory trees, and likely spawned the minor Oodtrees as well, so I think it's a fair assumption that Michaela might have planted the Heiligtree from an Oodtree seed. And if that was indeed the case, then it should have happened after the shattering, for before that, the Oodtree was considered perfect and eternal, and it wasn't even believed that Oodtree seeds could exist. But on the flipside, the golden epitaph sword that we mentioned earlier likely existed before the Shattering as it was created to commemorate Godwin's death. This sword displays the Halyg Tree sigil when its weapon art is activated, so one could infer that the Halyg Tree must have existed at this point too, right? So I guess it's always possible that Michaela somehow procured an Ode Tree Seed before the Shattering, or simply grew it from his own being, as he is a scion of the Golden Bough after all. But whatever the case, Michaela clearly decided that growing such a tree was important, and he even went so far as to water it with his own blood. This confirms that the Ode Tree is indeed a blood-sucking parasite. Just kidding. Sort of. I mean, you have to admit, it is pretty disturbing that an Ode Tree could flourish in such a manner. But this does lead us to the final question, which is, why was the Halyg Tree planted? What was the point of it? And at the end of the day, the main reason is always going to be because it's like the Ode Tree. It's natural to compare them, and the item descriptions seem to want you to compare them as well. The Ode Tree is this enormous icon of power and faith in the Lands Between, so evoking that and inspiring worship is clearly a valuable thing. But the Ode Tree was only really an icon of faith in its later years. Before that, it was a symbol of abundance, with light as warm as the gentle sun that could gradually heal all those who bathed in its rays. But perhaps most importantly, during this time of abundance, it would drip sacred dew, sap, or tears that could bestow blessings, form crystal tears, and even be embedded into talismans. These were treasured things, and naturally, this was an extremely valuable symbol for Mikala to evoke, since he is himself associated with dew and abundance in the cut content. And his Halyg Tree did drip with dew, the greenish amber of the Halyg Tree can even be seen in cut content items. It even looks as if it's mingled with a bit of Mikala's own blood, and that signature green hue of Halyg Tree amber is also seen in the Halyg Tree Knight Sword, which is not a cut weapon, and this was modelled after the Carian Knight's own swords, except it was embedded with amber from the Halyg Tree instead of glintstone. Okay, so the Halyg Tree is a great symbol of faith and power and abundance, and Mikala is related to abundance in the cut content, but what else does the Halyg Tree add in terms of value? Well, the Halyg Tree itself is something of a vessel, fit for a god, Mikala plants himself inside it later on, Melania returns home to it, and speaking of it being a home, many of the creatures have made their home within the tree, and within the brace that supports it as well. And I guess you could also argue that the Halyg Tree might be a sort of a tool to be used. After all, Marika puts the Ode Tree to use in such a way, using its roots to absorb people after their death, and perhaps even its branches to rebirth life. And then the Ode Tree is later used as a prison, with thorns that are almost entirely impenetrable. But I don't think Mikala planned to use the Halyg Tree in such a way. Perhaps the biggest difference between the Halyg Tree and the Ode Tree is that the Halyg Tree was built in a largely inhospitable region. It is extremely difficult to reach, and unlike the Ode Tree, it might not really be designed for the benefit of the vast majority of the world. As it stands, the Halyg Tree strikes me as being more like the Painted World from Dark Souls. It's a place for the outcasts, the heretical, and the malign. Not to mention the low and the meek, who are specifically named in the description of the Sacred Crown Helm. While many of the Scarlet Rod Afflicted seem to be here because of the eventual decay of the Halyg Tree, I think that there are a number of refugees here that would have been here before that, namely the Misbegotten, the Crystallian, these astray mages of Raya Lucaria, and of course Loretta, who deemed this place to be a great haven for the despised albinorics. The second generation albinorics even carry a weapon called the Ivory Sickle, which reads that these weapons are evidence of their dedication to the Halyg Tree, despite never having entered its presence. And we really don't find a single albinoric within the Halyg Tree. I'll admit, I do find this a bit strange. You do find quite a few albinorics so close to the Halyg Tree, it's a bit strange to me they don't go just that little bit further. The reason given for the first generation of albinorics not being at the Halyg Tree is given by Albus, who says that their faded legs are the reason for that. But yeah, we find them defending Michaela and his Halyg Tree all the same, at the Ordina Liturgical Town, which takes us to the Halyg Tree via a puzzle within an Evergale. The word liturgical means relating to public worship, and this town is fittingly filled with many statues of Michaela sitting alone, cradling what might have become the Halyg Tree back when it was still just a sapling. I also find it interesting that the Halyg Tree is never called out as competing with the Ord Tree, or never called out for housing all these undesirables. Perhaps the House of the Ord Tree was happy to see ungraceful folk leave their lands. Perhaps the Halyg Tree was extremely well hidden from everyone, and they didn't know. Or perhaps Michaela could just get away with it, because he was beloved by all. For example, the Bewitching Branch is an item that you can create from Michaela's lilies, and it is blessed with an incantation of unalloyed gold, and reads, The Empyrean Michaela is loved by many people. Indeed, he has learned very well how to compel such affection. And that second part that says he has learned how to compel affection, to me that's saying that Michaela is very good at knowing how to inspire others' affection to his own advantage. And nowhere is this more clear, I think, than at Castle Sol. This is the Halyg Tree Secret Medallion. It's furnished with that signature green amber, and it features the Halyg Tree in the background, for it allows you to access a secret, lower level of the Grand Lift of Rold, and progress through the consecrated snowfields to this secret place. Getting both halves of this secret medallion is therefore extremely desirable, for the medallion has another name, it's called Michaela's Favor. Michaela's favor can be yours. Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter. The all-hearing slaughtered. But alas, it was for naught. But all you need do is snatch it from the big pot. Gideon is the all-hearing man in this dialogue, and he slaughtered an entire village just for one half of this medallion, but he did not find it in Albus' possession. But you can, and the other half is at Castle Sol, right before a nameless phantom who says this. Lord Michaela, forgive me. The sun has not been swallowed. Our prayers were lacking. Your comrade remains soulless. I will never set my eyes upon it now. Your divine Halyg Tree. So this phantom seemingly has, or I guess had, one half of the medallion, and yet he laments that he will now never set eyes upon the Halyg Tree. To me, this suggests that Michaela might have been withholding the second half of the medallion from him, or that this phantom believed that he could solicit the second half of the medallion from Michaela and make it to the Halyg Tree, if he achieved his goal here at Castle Sol and basically earned Michaela's favour. But what exactly was supposed to happen here at Castle Sol? What does it mean when the phantom says, the sun has not been swallowed, our prayers were lacking, your comrade remains soulless? It means, I think, that the residents of Castle Sol and Michaela were attempting to restore the dead soul of Godwin the Golden. And just to refresh your memory, when a fragment of the Rune of Death was used to kill Godwin, it was also being used at the exact same time to kill Ranni, and since they perished at the same time, Ranni lost her body, and Michaela's demigod brother, Godwin, perished in Sol alone. And despite this death seeming so final, Michaela clearly believes that some sort of ritual performed here could restore the soul of his comrade. For example, here's some more dialogue from a different phantom, that reads, O great sun, frigid sun of Sol, surrender yourself to the eclipse, grant life to the soulless bones. But the question is, how? How does that work? How does an eclipse restore life to Godwin? Now you can just take Michaela at face value, and trust that he knows what he's doing, or we can try to learn as much as we can about the eclipse, and see if we can reason out the mechanism behind this process. So at Castle Sol, we find the Eclipse Chotel, which reads, Storied sword and treasure of Castle Sol, that depicts an eclipsed sun, drained of colour. In Sol, the sight of an eclipse inspires a dreadful awe, preventing an onlooker from averting his gaze. The most important part of this description, though, is the part that says it's the storied sword of Castle Sol, as this proves that the veneration of the eclipse here goes back a long way. But what does an eclipse represent? So according to the Eclipse Crest Shields, the eclipsed sun, drained of colour, is the protective star of soulless demigods. Honestly, I think calling it a protective star is kind of the closest we come to understanding the mechanism here, because you could reason that a protective star might be a sort of outer god that lends them power, though that is just speculation. The description goes on to say that the sun in Eclipse is said to be the symbol of the wandering mausoleum where the soulless demigods slumber. So note that it says demigods plural here. Now, this could be because the wandering mausoleums come to house many demigods from a gameplay point of view, because you can take their remembrances here, but it could be a word that is slightly lost in translation, as the Japanese version of the word demigods does not specify whether it's a plural or whether it's a singular word. So my take on this is that I think the wandering mausoleums became necessary when Godwin died. I think that the mausoleum was intended to be a resting place for him initially, but then also for any future demigods, as all of a sudden, all of their true deaths had become possible as well, with the theft of a fragment of the Rune of Death. The mausoleum knights themselves are these headless soldiers who behead themselves, willingly following their master into death. As such, they become these headless spirits, tied to the land so that they might better defend the walking mausoleums. They also carry eclipse-crested shields, and the eclipse is said to aid the mausoleum knights by keeping destined death at bay. It is their symbol, and by keeping destined death at bay, maybe it's helping to keep their souls tied to the land? We could speculate for a long time on how the eclipse has this power, and I've done my best. Maybe other people have a better take on it, and maybe you guys do in the comments, but in the end, it's simpler just to trust that Mikkela knew what he was doing with the eclipse at Castle Sol, where he wanted to block out the sun and restore Godwin's soul. All that said, we can't trust him too much, I guess. Because it's important to remember that this ritual failed. According to this phantom, the sun was not swallowed, and I guess the protective star of the soulless demigods did not listen to their prayers, and it did not appear. But it is really fascinating to learn that such a thing might even be possible. That Godwin, whose soul seems to be as dead as Ranni's body, might actually not be? So if his soul is somewhere, then where has it fled to? A part of me wonders. If his soul is lost, then maybe it's lost within a dream? One theory I did come up with regarding the mechanism by which Godwin's soul is brought back by the eclipse is that his soul might be brought back by bringing about a sort of artificial dusk with the eclipse. That's because those who live in death are called the Duskborn, after all, so there is an association between night and death, to be sure. And there's also an association between death and sleep. For example, when you pursue Thea's questline, you use her as a medium to enter Godwin's deathbed dream, which is an entire dreamscape where the dragon Fortisax is futilely fighting against the death in his companion. And then there's Roger, who speaks this line of dialogue as he is on the precipice of succumbing to Deathroot. Maybe I should tell you, lately, I feel I'm on the precipice of falling into a deep, fathomless slumber. He does say he's about to fall into sleep. So in conclusion, a realm of death does seem accessible through dream. And I think this is the perfect time to mention that Michaela has an alter ego. Some say she is a comely young girl, others are sure he is a boy. This is where we have to talk about the enigmatic figure named Saint Trina. Perhaps the biggest in-game clue about Saint Trina's true identity is Trina's Lily, which bears this undeniable resemblance to Michaela's Lily of Unalloyed Gold. Its description reveals that it is a symbol of faith in Saint Trina, dulls the senses, preventing agitation. Naturally, it can be used to craft a bunch of sleep-afflicting items, like Saint Trina's arrow, which states that the sweet oblivion of sleep can become quite the habit. And it tells of the priests of Saint Trina who use these arrows to spread their teachings, though the Japanese description seems to specify that these were more of a tool used for their rituals. So, it's largely left to your imagination as to what rituals these priests might have been performing, though I will mention that it seems Saint Trina might actually be able to be found somewhere within sleep. This is suggested by Feather's Cookbook, which reads, A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by Saint Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber. We get a side profile of her in the hilt of Saint Trina's sword, which hints at that flowing a stray hair that she has, and then we get a much better front-on view of this feminine adult form upon Saint Trina's torch. The carvings depict Saint Trina, but in adult form, somewhat unnervingly. The carving is indeed unnerving, and it's certainly strange considering Michaela is supposed to be eternally a child. It raises the question, what has to happen for Michaela to grow up into this? And why is this bizarre creature the adult form that he takes? Another question worth asking, I think, is whether Michaela even has total control of Saint Trina. What if he's in a similar situation to Marika Radagon, where their alter ego is an opposite of sorts, and able to act almost as if they have their own free will? So all of this is definitely a little bit of a disturbing view of what Saint Trina could be, but I guess we do have cut content that does somewhat reassure me that their alter ego is still a benevolent person. This cut content was first showcased by Sekiro Doobie, and this cut content is truly ancient. It exists in one of the oldest versions of the game that we know about, so a lot has probably changed since then, but regardless, here we can learn about Saint Trina's crystal ball, which once read, So this reveals that this cut version of Saint Trina even once had sympathy for those afflicted by the Flame of Frenzy. They even went so far as to teach the merchants their songs. The description of Michaela's songs as a lullaby is referenced by the modern day sleeppot description, which reads, This is the closest thing we have to Dream Mist as well, which was an item that you could again once collect from sleeping enemies, and after you did this, you were supposed to sell this dream mist to the merchants, who used it to quell their Flame of Frenzy. But as the merchants once said, whoever it was that sings, now sings no longer, and this is a detail that has remained intact even in the final version of Elden Ring, with Saint Trina. Trina's sword stating that Saint Trina's appearance was as sudden as their disappearance. Something clearly happened to Michaela that prevented them from continuing their work as Saint Trina, and that is what we will discuss next. At some point, Michaela embedded himself into the Halic Tree. Why he did this is never explicitly stated, but I think we can make a good attempt at puzzling it out. So Michaela famously watered the Halic Tree with his own blood, since it was a sapling, so I guess you could argue that he embedded himself in it to simply feed the tree more. Which I guess is possible, because the tree does eventually wither without Michaela inside it, and Gideon seems to tie his removal with the death of the Halic Tree, or it turning into a husk. But I don't think that can be the only reason why he embedded himself. For instance, look closely at the Halic Tree roots, and you'll see the form of a tree-like woman, and where her womb should be, there's a gap. A gap that once contained Michaela's cocoon, cradled by the Halic Tree. Now, either Michaela was attempting to fuse into and become this woman-like figure, who might even be the adult form shown on Saint Trina's torch, or there was a rebirth occurring here. This is a cocoon, within a womb, after all, so rebirth could have been the intent here. But regardless, it seems things ended prematurely, for Michaela would eventually be ripped out of the womb, and the Halic Tree would split and decay. And so, when we arrive at the Halic Tree, and the town of Elfale that is built into the brace that supports it, the music here hits extremely hard. This place is just so sorrowful, for the Halic Tree, and Michaela's lilies, and even Saint Trina's lilies are all wilting, and all who live here are just hoping and praying for their lord to return. I love the little detail of the guards looking outwards, and sitting dejectedly. To make matters worse for them, it was here that they realised that the sacred light inside them would explode upon their imminent deaths. And yet, in spite of this, their spirit ashes show their faith and state. May the flash of our deaths guide Michaela's return. And Melania is here too, holding to the husk of Michaela, dreaming and waiting for Michaela to return, and believing full well that he will. Melania's set reveals that she believes her brother will keep his promise. So what was that promise, I wonder? Was it merely to return? Or was it something more? How much does Melania know? Why did she fight Redan? We'll have to talk about all of that in another video. So there is still faith. There's even this one phantom in the consecrated snowfields who has somehow puzzled out who took Michaela, and even where they are, he is pointed towards the portal that takes you to Moguen Palace and Mogue the Omen. So indeed, it was the demigod Mogue who somehow broke into the Heilig tree and absconded with Michaela's infant form. And it's with him that this story ends, or maybe it's where this story truly begins. So if you're not familiar, Mogue is the Omen's son of Godfrey and Marika, and being an omen of royalty, he was born into a wretched mire of filth in the subterranean shunning grounds below Leyndell Capital. But unlike his brother Morgoth, who reviled his accursed blood, Mogue reveled in it, and it was assumedly because of this accursed blood that he chanced a meeting with an outer god, called the Mother of Truth. And as Mogue stood before her deep underground, his accursed blood erupted with fire, and he was truly besotted with the defilement that he was born into. Mogue is just one of many characters who discovers a new identity in the ways that they have been discarded by the world, and how could he not, for his defilement was validated by nothing less than an outer god. And as always, we know very little about this outer god. We know she is called the Mother of Truth, and the formless mother. We know that she desires wounds, and bestows power upon accursed blood. Her followers can thrust their arms into her body to scatter bloodflame, and followers of Mogue can share in the Lord of Blood's power, and send bloodflies before them. There's even been some speculation in my recent shorts, and my tiktoks as well, that the formless mother is also an outer god called the Blood Star. But the one thing that all outer gods seem to have in common is that they all require vessels to move through. So in this case, the formless mother's vessel was Mogue. For example, the sacred spear that he wields is a weapon, but it's also an instrument of communion, and Mogue may well be doing her bidding with his actions. These actions included him starting a new dynasty called Moguen, deep below the earth, in the grounds of these ancient dynastic remains. This is a secret place, difficult to reach, and it was here that Mogue brought the infant Michaela, torn as he was from his cocoon. I mean, that's how we see him in his opening cutscene, but in-game, Michaela seems to be back with a new cocoon here. You can even see it sat upon this giant pelvic bone, which seems to be a reference to the womb of the halig tree woman that he was literally ripped from. And it's from the Remembrance of the Bloodlord that we can learn of Mogue's intent here. He wished to raise Michaela to full godhood, and become his consort, taking the role of monarch. To this end, Mogue has begun soliciting blood offerings to Michaela. And that certainly explains the state of so many who reside here. According to the Lord of Blood's exultation talisman, he proclaimed, And then, to return to Mogue's Remembrance, it's stated that so far, this has all been in vain. For, no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber Mogue tried to share, he received no response from the young Empyrean. So maybe nothing will happen. Or maybe, according to the Pureblood Knight's Medal, it is not yet time. For Mogue yet slumbers beside the divinity. Be patient. The new dynasty is nigh. What do you think? I mean, it's kind of hard to know. Even Gideon has no clue. But something does seem to be happening to Michaela in there. He has clearly grown, for one, since being taken, so maybe his adult form is manifesting? And personally, this reminds me a lot of Berserk, which we know Miyazaki is always inspired by. Spoiler warning, really, you should watch that show. But there's this moment, at the very end of the first chapter, where Griffith betrays his companions in this sacrificial ceremony of carnage and bloodshed, in order to be inaugurated and reborn as a god, within an egg of sorts. This really reminds me of that. It also reminds me of a scene with Griffith, where he allows himself to be abused, basically, in order to get what he wants. So I wonder, what if this was also what Michaela wanted? We know that he is extremely proficient at compelling others to love him, and Mogue is clearly enraptured. We know that Michaela is an Empyrean prodigy, and we know that his sister who knows him best has total faith that he will return. You'd think he's still in control of the situation somehow, but that could be a part of the tragedy, and Michaela, this benevolent being, might not have predicted this at all, and is now being completely taken advantage of. Maybe he did intend to be taken, but he's going to get more than he bargained for with the Mother of Truth, or maybe Michaela's fate really is long gone. There's one other thing I want to mention. There is this place called Michaela's Hideaway, in the Altus Plateau, and here we can loot Amber Starlight, which Sullivus mentions is the very fate of a demigod. Clearly, since it's here, you'd think it's Michaela's fate, right? And then you also have to consider that the cut content that we are basing so much of this video on is very much removed from the game, because it might not fit the developer's intent. That's always possible. So I really do hope you all bear that in mind, as I would really hate to promote ideas that are against the developer's vision for this character. But I really do think that it's a possibility that we're going to one day enter the dream of this slumbering demigod. After all, there was once a cut character called Rico, who was supposed to say the following, standing before Michaela's cocoon at Mergwin Palace. He says, Additionally, I have found it, Saint Trina's, no, Lord Michaela's cadaver, such that I may aid you, O Lord. So please, I hope you welcome your humble servant Rico into your dream, the world of your heart. Indeed, I beg you grant my wish, that when you transcend from Empyrean to God, allow me a place by your side. Plus, if we do get DLC, it's going to need a new Great Rune to acquire, right? It's a huge gameplay mechanic in these games, and it'd be weird if DLC came and you couldn't get more Great Runes. Apart from Michaela's Great Rune, the only one we don't know about also is Ranni's Great Rune, which was allegedly cast aside. So there's always that to consider. But hopefully we get some DLC to answer these questions. Or more likely, we'll get DLC that will give us more questions than we started with. That's always how it seems to go. I really hope they throw us some good curveballs with this one, as they always do. But regardless, it's always a ton of fun to speculate with you all, so if you're still listening to this extremely long video, thank you for giving me your time today. Thank you to Quelaag for reviewing this script for me. Thank you Mispap for the incredible visuals, as always. And I also want to give a sincere and really reverential shout out to Eugenia Lysa, who created the speculative visuals of Saint Trina. Please follow her work in the description, she's one of the most talented artists that I've ever known. And yeah, thank you, as always of course, for watching my videos, and I'll see you next time.\n",

      "[Doc 10: The Lore of Elden Ring is Rotten]\n",
      "The Scarlet Rot is one of the deadliest things in the Lands Between, for it has no real cure, and famously, even the demigods could not stave off its effects..I guess no one told them about preserving boluses..anyway, what's really interesting about the Scarlet Rot is that it's actually a very old legend, one that predates Melania and all of the horrors found in Celed. And so, to understand where it all began, we have to go below, to the Lake of Rot, where we can find a few item descriptions that speak of this time. For example, here in the southeastern corner, we can loot a crown of mushrooms that forms this towering headpiece, and it reads, Long ago, great lords served the Scarlet Rot. Perhaps such fungal bodies served as their crowns. And the rest of this set is made up of the mushroom set, which are considered holy vestments for those enraptured by the Scarlet Rot that root them to the earth. So already, we have this hierarchy of mushroom lords that served the Scarlet Rot back then, as well as worshippers who venerated it. And you might think it's strange that these beings might worship or serve a sickness, but the Scarlet Rot is so much more than that, because the Scarlet Rot is no mere disease. No, for proof of that, one only need look at the Crystallian. Crystallian are inorganic beings, and yet they can be afflicted by the Rot just like any other. There's even some Crystallians that are infused with Rot, and can spread it to others as well. Because it's not really just a disease. Instead, the map for the Lake of Rot calls it the Divine Essence of an Outer God, something that was sealed away long ago in this underground world. And if you've been following Elden Ring lore for any length of time, you should be no stranger to the concept of an Outer God. They are these indeterminable, abstract beings that impress an order or a will upon the world through their avatars, their servants, and their vessels. And in the case of the Scarlet Rot, its order is one of decay, where beings are put into a progressing state of death, with the intent to achieve this glorious rebirth that will follow that process. The Poison Armament description tells us this, saying that those who dwell within poison know Rot all too well, the death that begets life, that comes to all equally. That is to say, it is the cycle of rebirth put into practice. A great example of this is Mikolas' Halic Tree, which might be completely dead were it not for the fungal growths that have sprouted upon the tree. And of course, we also see this in Caled, where flowers of the Rot are on the very precipice of budding, despite all the decay. Of course, it's debatable whether this type of life is even desirable at all, but you can't argue that it is life, and the agents of the Rot God certainly find it desirable, so they do their utmost to spark this sacred cycle of rebirth in others, infecting them with poison and Rot, and putting this cycle of rebirth into practice. On that note, there is one extremely curious item that you can find down in the Grand Cloister, and it's called the Scorpion Stinger. This is a dagger that's glistening with Scarlet Rot, and it's called a Ceremonial Tool, which I think means that any ceremony that used this dagger would have been a ceremony to stab and infect another being with the Scarlet Rot. It would have been a ceremony of spreading their treasured affliction to others. But what's really interesting about this dagger is that it's fashioned from a great scorpion's tail, and it's also specifically said to have been crafted from the relic of a sealed outer god. And when you consider that phrasing, it makes you realise that it's saying that this dagger was fashioned from a relic of the Rot God, who was also a great scorpion. That's what it sounds like it's saying. Anyway, I mean, many historical relics in our history are often the physical remains of deceased saints or holy persons, so the God of Rot might really be, or at least might have manifested as a great scorpion. So I guess the Scorpion Stinger is kind of like the Eye of the Fel God, or the Three Fingers of Frenzy, or the whole winged theme that death has going on. It's a small remaining hint at the visual identity of these ephemeral outer gods that is intended to stimulate the imagination, even if we never truly find out what these outer gods look like. And whatever Rot truly is, it and its Scarlet Rot essence was eventually conquered, or sealed at least. This was done by a legendary figure known as the Blind Swordsman. As the story goes, the Blind Swordsman was favoured by a fairy called the Dancer in Blue. The fairy bestowed upon them a flowing curved sword, which was patterned after flowing water, and with this sword, the Blind Swordsman sealed away an ancient god, a god that was Rot itself. There's quite a bit to unpack in these descriptions. First, who or what was the fairy called the Blue Dancer? Well, I think that the Warrior's blue cloth set gives us a clue. It reveals that the blue colour of its fabric symbolises brisk waters, and the cloth doll that represents the Blue Dancer is styled to look just like water. The description goes on to say that just as still waters turn foul, stagnation leads to decay, so warriors must remain ever drifting. It's essentially saying that flowing water is the very antithesis to Rot, which thrives in stagnant water. And I think, and this is just speculation, but I think that the Blue Fairy might essentially be a sort of river spirit. If you've ever seen Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, then you might know what type of being I'm talking about. In that movie, just quickly, a stinking sludge monster comes to the bathhouse, where it is eventually revealed that it's actually a river spirit, whose river was bogged down and corrupted by pollution. But once his waters are unblocked, the river spirit is restored. And Elden Ring, by comparison, does also have two legendary rivers called the Shifra and the Ainzel, which just so happened to flow underground next to and around the Scarlet Rot that was eventually sealed all that time ago. So I don't think that it's a stretch to think that the Blue Fairy might have occupied or might have been a supernatural extension of those underground rivers. I think it's a fun theory, and I think it helps to explain the Blue Fairy's relationship with water, and why it might be a natural enemy of the Rot God. So the Blue Fairy gave the Blind Swordsman a flowing sword, and he fought with the power of flowing water to seal away the Rot God. But what's unclear here is how exactly the Scarlet Rot God was sealed away by the Blind Swordsman. Did he, you know, sword in hand, battle a great scorpion boss in one-on-one combat and just seal its essence away? Or was their battle more of an abstract one, where the Eternal City dams were built, and rivers were rerouted to encircle the Rot and contain it underground, or something like that? These details are left to your imagination, but one way or another, the Scarlet Rot God was sealed away, but it was not defeated, and eventually it would return. And this time, it would do so in an Empyrean vessel, corrupting Melania, a demigod, at the very moment of her birth. Like her brother, Michaela, Melania was born an Empyrean. Empyrean meaning she was essentially a valid candidate to replace Queen Marika as a god, and as such, it seems she was a ripe candidate for an outer god's meddling. And it's unclear how the Rot God afflicted Melania as soon as she was born, but it did, and that's a shame, because Melania's Great Rune does state that it should have been the most sacred Great Rune of them all, were it not for what I assume was the Rot God's meddling. And speaking of Great Runes, in the sister video to this one, we talk about how Michaela was essentially the flip side to Melania in many ways, especially in cut content, where the twins were born of an inseparable fate, and said to hold the runes of both abundance and decay between them. And to reflect this duality, it seems, Michaela is in this constant state of overflowing abundance, while Melania was in this constant state of overflowing death, essentially. We sort of see this tragedy unfolding in a few statues of Melania, since you can see back then she did actually have all her limbs once upon a time, until the Rot continued to take hold, moving her inexorably towards her inevitable death and rebirth as well. And that must have felt inevitable, for it seems like in these early days, there were few known ways to ward off the Rot. Fire was probably the obvious one, and then there was also the act of consecration which was used, which is essentially the act of declaring something is sacred, which was done to the weaponry of Melania and her knights, and apparently it helped their armaments, at least, to resist the Rot. But their flesh was still susceptible. Melania's knights were therefore called the Clean Rot Knights, and they vowed to fight alongside Melania, despite the inevitable, if gradual, putrefaction of their flesh. And it was this fact that made these warriors so fierce, for they had basically already accepted their terrible fate, and so logically, they had nothing else to lose in battle. These knights were bestowed the Winged Sword insignia, given only to those who fought alongside Melania the Severed. Interestingly, this is the only item that gives Melania the title, the Severed, and I assume that it's referencing a time where Melania was known for her prowess, despite her fragmented body, as it's called in the Japanese. And I guess it's possible that she wasn't yet known as the Blade of Michaela at the time, though that's just my own speculation. At any rate, Melania Blade of Michaela is her most common title, and it's easy to see why she would dedicate herself to her brother so fully. For her brother was so dismayed by her condition that he dedicated himself to finding a treatment for the Rot, and this search for a cure dramatically affected Michaela's worldview. For instance, he was formerly a faithful fundamentalist of the Golden Order, with all the magic to boot, but he would abandon those practices as they could do nothing to treat his sister's accursed Rot. Instead, he pursued a path of Unalloyed Gold, and he crafted for Melania a needle that could be inserted into her flesh, granting relief from the Rot and preventing the progression of the Rotting Sickness. If you're interested in why Unalloyed Gold was able to do this and work that way, then I'd recommend you check out this video afterwards, which talks at length about Michaela. But we learn about the needle's specific effects in-game when we give it to a character called Millicent, who is also suffering from the Scarlet Rot. Millicent is this great parallel to Melania that teaches us so much about what Melania might have felt or experienced. So Millicent, too, has lost a limb, and she is also losing her memories, and when we find her, she is unable to even move. But as soon as we give her the needle, she's able to function and fight once more. Therefore, it's fair to assume that similar benefits were conferred upon Melania when her brother gave her the needle. It's also worth noting that the multiple needles we find in-game, they aren't finished. Even the final version of this needle can only be used in the storm beyond time at Farum Azula, where it allows you to cheat fate, essentially. And that makes sense here, because you're outside of time in this place, so maybe you can prevent these afflictions from the outer gods before they even happen. So perhaps if Michaela had been able to imbue his needle with some time warping capabilities, he could have eventually undone the effects of the rot god entirely, but again, the needle was unfortunately never finished. The needle isn't all that Michaela created with unalloyed gold. He also crafted for his sister a prosthetic arm, leg, helmet and armour of unalloyed gold, which again, like Millicent, surely allowed her to overcome her one-armed shortcoming and reach for newer heights as a fighter. So, Millenia's prospects were already looking up, but things didn't end there, for Millenia would go on to meet a man who would become her mentor, and he would give her this final invaluable tool that could be employed against the Scarlet Rot. We see their meeting play out on this image of the prosthesis wearer heirloom, which depicts a scene from a heroic tale. You can even see Millenia's prosthetic arm and leg in this image if you look closely, which is why I assume that this meeting took place after Michaela's intervention with all of the unalloyed gold prosthetics. So, her mentor was, as you might have guessed, the blind swordsman. The man who first sealed away the rot all those years ago, the very same, and after encountering her mentor and his flowing blade, she gained wings of unparalleled strength. This meeting says a lot about the blind swordsman. He must have known that Millenia was basically inhabited by his ancient enemy, and yet he doesn't attempt to kill her here. Instead, he takes her under his wing, and teaches her the techniques that he himself once used to curtail the rot in the first place. It's a pretty wise thing to do, and perhaps we shouldn't expect any less from someone who was able to defeat an outer god in the first place. So, this is why the skill on Millenia's blade is called the Waterfowl Dance. This is why Millenia recovers health by attacking during her boss fight. By moving relentlessly, like flowing water, the damage of the rot was offset, and Millenia was able to achieve unparalleled strength, and to maintain her pride. But it was that same pride that she would abandon in her fight with Radahn. Radahn was born of Queen Rinala, who was the Queen of Caria, and King Consort Radagon, who was previously a great champion of the Oodtree. Thus was the order of the moon and the Oodtree conjoined. And while Radahn was a true Carian, and certainly proficient in the art of sorcery, we can see in his character an inclination towards another path, an aspiration to be like Godfrey, for example, who was the first Elden Lord, and also his father Radagon, who would become the second Elden Lord. Caria was, after all, a largely matriarchal society, meaning that power was passed down to the princesses in the family. So perhaps it's no surprise that Radahn was not as motivated by his Carian heritage compared to his sister Ranni, for instance. So Radahn's set was decorated with a golden lion that symbolized Godfrey and his beast regent, and it states that from his youngest years, Radahn was naturally captivated by the Lord of the Battlefield. Then his golden helmet was designed with his flaming red hair in mind, which Radahn inherited from his father, drawing attention to the fact that he was fond of the heroic implications of being Radagon's son. Radahn and his knights were fittingly known as the Redmane, which conflates Radahn's red hair with the mane of Godfrey's lion, and Radahn was even quoted as saying, I was born a champion's cub, now I am the Lord of the Battlefield's lion, which borders on being a statement of complete loyalty to Godfrey and the Golden Order, but we'll get to that debate later. So naturally, this was a guy who reveled in the art of warfare, and even in his youth as a Carian royal, it seems Radahn was already a renowned general. We can infer this because of a man named Geron. The eccentrics armour specifically says that after spending time as a guest of the Carian royals, he became a guest commander for General Radahn. Therefore, Radahn must have still been in close contact with his Carian family, as Geron met Radahn through these Carian royals, and when they did meet, Geron and Radahn seemed to immediately share a certain bond, for despite Geron preferring to have a nomadic existence, he decided to become a guest commander for General Radahn. And then, despite the temporary implication of such a title, Geron this restless tumbleweed, as he was called, would become bound by honorable oath, and he and Redan swore a vow of honorable death to one another, promising that they would die honorably in battle, even if it was death by the other's hand. So it's not stated which battles that Redan was fighting at the time, nor which war he required a new guest commander for, but then the world is very different at the time, and there's so much of the Lands Between's history that we don't know about, so I guess it's possible that the battles were being fought for distant lands like Limgrave and Caled. The Limgrave East map does say, after all, that this path here was trod by many a soldier in the past. Maybe Redan's forces took this path as well, and this was before Caled was even afflicted with the Scarlet Rot, so things might have looked really different here. Although, admittedly, we do have this shot from this trailer that shows that it still kind of looks a bit like a red hellscape here, with the red sky, and this was technically before the Scarlet Rot took hold. Caled did still have some culture to boast of, though. For example, in the very middle of Caled, there is, or was, a town of sorcery called Celia, and despite Redan's relationship with Caria, and Briarlew Caria as well, presumably, it was here in Celia that he studied, learning gravitational magics that likely could not be taught anywhere else. He did this, as the story goes, all so he would never have to abandon his beloved but scrawny steed, for gravitational magics could relieve the weight of Redan, and allow his scrawny horse to carry him evermore. Also, in case you don't know, the horse's name is Lennard, according to the data, so that is the name that we're going to use going forward, and what's interesting about Lennard is that he's specifically called out as being scrawny, as if that's the reason why he can't carry Redan, who is enormous. Shouldn't Redan's size be the reason why he can't ride his horse? So I think, personally, that Redan actually didn't become as large as he is for a very long time, and I think there's some good evidence to back that up. For one, his throne in Leyndell is of regular size. Two, his portrait is of a simple grown man, and lastly, we see a brief shot of Redan fighting in this image, where he barely even matches Morgoth in size, so personally, I think that Redan probably only grew in size when he acquired a great rune. Regardless, at this stage anyway, it's clear that Redan initially learned gravitational magic for the sake of his horse, but that gravitational skill set would certainly come in handy as the years went on. For one, these gravitational magics were passed on to some of his elite soldiers, like Ogre, who was the longest-serving member of the Redmane Knights, who studied techniques to manipulate gravity alongside Redan. The equipment and the skill sets of the Redmane Knights really were very inspired by Redan. For example, the surcoat of Redan's Redmane Knights depicts a Redmaned lion raising a sword in the image of Redan. All of them proved that they were worthy of the Redmane name. Even their greatshield's design takes that symbolism further, being shaped like a fang and featuring the crest of a Redmaned lion, and these knights were strong like Redan, too, with descriptions stating that they were reputed to be masterful warriors, and it was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness. But for all of their prowess in battle, a conflict was coming that no military strength could ward away. And I'm not talking about the Scarlet Rot, I'm talking about the stars. But luckily for this upcoming conflict, Redan was able to solicit the help of an extremely knowledgeable teacher. According to the Gravity Well Sorcery, Redan's master was an Alabaster Lord with skin of stone, and these Onyx and Alabaster Lords were a different race entirely to humans, and were said to have risen to life when a meteor struck long ago. And the Meteorite Sorcery tells us that the reason they were called Lords was in reverential fear of their destructive power. And it seems like Redan was soliciting their help because a similarly meteoric destructive power was on its way to Celia. So earlier we established that he explicitly did learn gravitational magic so that he could ride his horse, but the Collapsing Stars Sorcery also explicitly says that he learned gravitational techniques so that he could challenge the stars, which I think suggests that there were two distinct periods of learning here for Redan. Learning for the sake of his horse, and then learning for the sake of keeping Celia safe. And there's also quite a bit of evidence that suggests that Redan's actions here were in defense. For example, the Sword Gravestone in Caelid specifically tells us that Redan held Celia secure. The Starscourge Heirloom tells us that Redan confronted the Falling Stars, as if they were the aggressors. Finally, this event was also called the Starscourge Conflict, suggesting that there was a clash of some kind here, like a back-and-forth, if you will. So Redan seemed to anticipate that this event was coming, but I guess that isn't so strange when you consider that Redan was of Carian lineage, who were renowned for reading fate in the stars. So I would think that anticipating a starfall would be pretty straightforward for them, and I think it would make sense that Redan would want to intervene if it was headed for Celia, which is where he learned his magic from in the first place. So Redan took defensive measures, and I guess you might argue that he even went a bit overboard, for he didn't just defend Celia from the Falling Stars, he actually sealed the stars' movements completely. So after Redan challenged the stars, the fate in the night sky was said to be no more, and this manifests quite literally in Ranni's questline, for example, where Redan has to be killed so that the stars can be unfrozen, so that one of them can literally smash into Limgrave and open a path to Nocron. If not for Redan, I feel like a star would have smashed through Celia instead, and opened a path to Nocron that way all those years ago. The eternal city of Nocron is said, after all, to sleep below Celia, so Redan really might have intervened here at the very last moment. Since a star is released and hits Limgrave as soon as you kill Redan, though I'll admit that it is a bit strange that that star hits Limgrave and not Celia, which he was said to defend. I wonder why. Anyway, there's one more thing I want to talk about here, and it's that you could also make the argument that Redan might have intervened at Celia and frozen the stars on behalf of the Golden Order. After all, the telescope item description literally says that the fate once writ in the night skies was fettered by the Golden Order, and Redan was a fanboy of Radagon and Godfrey, who were two proponents of the Golden Order, so it's definitely possible that he did this on the Golden Order's behalf. Personally, though, I think that both things can be true. I think that Redan was clearly motivated to defend Celia from Starfall, and I think that the Golden Order did stand to benefit from one of its vassals achieving such a feat. Redan, and most of the demigods at that stage for that matter, were technically on the side of Marika's Golden Order. So I guess technically, Redan was aligned with the Golden Order and could have fettered the stars on their behalf, technically, but the impression that I get from Redan is that he has no real loyalty to anyone other than himself and his men. This is my speculation, but I think this because he's not really hated by anyone in the current age or anyone in-game. Even his brother Rikard has his picture up on the wall, and Rikard famously hated anything to do with the Golden Order. So while I think Redan served the intent of the Golden Order, I don't think he was beholden to it, especially not in the later years when the Elden Ring was shattered, because remember this cutscene with Morgoth? Willful traitors all! Morgoth labels all of the demigods as traitors to the Golden Order, including Redan, who we do see in a clash with Morgoth, suggesting that he might have abandoned his loyalty to order and marched on Leyndell after the shattering, before Redan, like his demigod kin, had claimed a great rune. And it's easy to assume that a warmonger like him would have had great ambitions for power, and might have even aspired to become Elden Lord. And it's around this time, when the demigods were clashing, that Melania enters the picture once more, because Melania, Blade of Michaela, was marching towards Caelid, past Godric in Limgrave, and towards Redan. Godric, the God of War Honestly, Godric's nothing more than a jumped-up country bumpkin. Lord? Oh, don't make me laugh. First, he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Redan in that castle. Then he insulted Melania, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots, rather than die like a man. Ha! Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse? This dialogue from Kenneth Hight is a great piece of lore, as it tells us about this crucial, late part of the Shattering War. At this point, Godric had just failed to usurp Leyndell capital, and had fled, with his tail between his legs, to Stormvale. Here, he hid in fear of Redan, who was a close neighbor in Caelid, and it makes sense that he'd fear Redan, who was considered by many to be the strongest of the demigods. But while he was hiding here, a different army approached, from the north, not the south, as Godric must have feared. Melania and her clean-wrought knights were passing Stormvale on their southwards march from the Heiligtree to Caelid, and this event, this passing, is marked at the Leonia Highway sword gravestones, which state These gravestones tend to mark points of battle, and Kenneth does state that Godric insulted Melania and lost to her in battle. So, I assume this is where that happened. As to the nature of the insult, well, we have cut dialogue from Godric to help us out here. There is only one tree, and only its branches, that bathe in true rays of gold. Not the fool-omened king, nor the rank-malformed twins. So Godric considered Michaela and Melania rank and malformed, so I assume the insult was along those lines, which was not smart on Godric's part. Melania must have messed him up, but tellingly, she did not kill him. And that's a curious detail, because this was the Shattering War. We're supposed to believe that all of the demigods were fighting for power, but if Melania was seeking power here, and looking for others' great runes to acquire in order to restore the Elden Ring, and live up to Michaela or her own Empyrean promise, then you'd think that she would have killed Godric, that she wouldn't have shown him mercy. But instead, she lets him live. So, to me, that suggests that Melania might not have been on this southward march to take power. Because if she didn't claim Godric's great rune, then she probably wasn't here for Redan's either. So, why then? Why did Melania come full force towards Redan on this southward march? I feel like there are three options. Four, if you count the theory that Melania might have chased down Redan in order to get control of the Elden Ring, but as I've just explained, I feel like that's unlikely. Option two, although it's still unlikely in my opinion, is that Melania might have sought out Redan simply for the sake of fighting him. He was, after all, widely considered the mightiest of the demigods, as was Melania in many cases. So, it's not ridiculous to think that both of them might have fought simply for the sake of pitting their strength against one another. But that's a pretty unsatisfactory answer, in my opinion. Option three, I feel, could be because Melania was looking for her brother. At this point, Mikala could have already been stolen away by Moog, so perhaps she was simply looking for him. She pretty intentionally makes a beeline towards the south and towards Celed, and Moog's palace is essentially underneath Celia and underneath the area where Redan and Melania fought. So, I guess it's possible that Melania had some intel leading her here in a search for Mikala. But again, this is only speculation. But my favorite theory is the fourth one, which is that Melania, and by extension Mikala, may have wanted Redan dead for the same reason that Ranni eventually does, so that the stars could resume their movement, bringing certain fates back into play. And you might be asking, but why would Mikala want the stars to resume their movement? Well, perhaps Mikala's own fate was locked in stasis. We do find a demigod's amber starlight shard in Mikala's hideaway, after all, and I feel like it should be concerning that his fate might have fallen like this. But the best answer, I think, is that Mikala wanted the stars back in motion so that the moon could properly eclipse the sun. This was a ritual that Mikala seemed to believe would revive Godwin the Golden, his brother. And we talk about this a lot more in this video, and I can definitely see how the stars being in stasis would prevent the moon from eclipsing the sun. So, I really like this answer, but I'd love to hear your theories. Surely there's more than just these four options. But in the end, there's only really one answer that I'm confident in, and it's that we can't confidently say for sure why Melania fought Redan. Not yet, anyway. But whatever the reason, it must have been a good one, because it was during this battle that Melania sacrificed everything. There is something I must return to Melania, the will that was once her own, the dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the Scarlet Rot, the pride she abandoned, to meet Redan's measure. In Elden Ring's story trailers, we see this legendary fight play out. Clean Rot knights finally arrive with Melania, facing off against the Redmane knights and manage to plunge a ton of spears into Redan during their clash. You can actually see these spears still sticking out of his back to this day. Then, Melania and Redan appear to be the only two left standing. Melania sacrifices her prosthetic arm to get close to Redan, grabbing her blade and plunging it into both of them. Giving us a close-up view of the two characters. Here, Redan looks monstrous, which I theorize could again be because he's tainted with the madness of a great rune, though that is just speculation. And we can also see Melania's lips moving here, muttering some final words, or perhaps the incantation for the Scarlet Aeonia, which envelops herself and Redan, putting an end to their fight. In this video's first chapter, we talked extensively about Melania's battle against the Scarlet Rot within her, but in this moment, she seems to lose that fight, maybe intentionally, and she allows the Scarlet Rot to take hold. Millicent, who is a great parallel to Melania, says that this is when she sacrificed her dignity, her sense of self, her will, and her pride. Melania did all of this just so that she could meet Redan's measure. Thus did the Scarlet Rot explode outwards, infecting Redan and the very land itself, as their battle came to a horrific standstill. In the end, neither party was in a state to continue fighting, so technically Melania didn't lose, so she was technically still undefeated. Few survived the Battle of Aeonia, but one who did was the clean-rot knight Finlay, who, in an unimaginable act of heroism, carried the slumbering form of Melania all the way back to the Halic Tree. They managed this alone, fending off all manner of foes along the way. But back at the center of Caelid, Melania's Scarlet Bloom remained. A nearby phantom's dialogue reads, Sublime, I tell you. The very first flower of Aeonia bloomed on this very spot. Melania, may you blossom into a goddess. In the present day... Kaelid features, at its center, a giant tree that spirals in a similar manner to Melania's first Scarlet Bloom. So it probably is the same Scarlet Bloom. As the Phantom says, this was the very first flower of Aeonia, and the beginning of the Scarlet Swamp in this land. And at the very center of that is another curious thing. There's a boss called Commander O'Neil, who carries the Commander Standard, which reads, And it's hard for me to say exactly whose side O'Neil would have been on. He summons the spirits of exiled soldiers, who themselves have no real affiliation to speak of. Though, I will say that you can summon one of Millicent's sisters to help you in the fight against O'Neil, which might suggest that he's opposed to the idea of Rot, and that he might have fought for Redan. Although, I feel like you could go both ways on this, because the Commander Standard says that his lord was fled, and both Melania and Redan fled this battle. Anyway, when you defeat O'Neil by luring him into the geysers of Scarlet Rot, because it's funny, he doesn't just drop the Commander Standard, he also drops an heirloom of the Battle of Aeonia. A broken needle of unalloyed gold that was once buried within Melania's own flesh, repelling her Scarlet Rot until it snapped. A really interesting question here, considering the needle is broken, is whether Melania snapped the needle intentionally when she plunged her blade into herself and Redan. Perhaps she knew that it would cause the Rot within her to flare up worse than ever if the needle was broken, and allow her to defeat Redan. Millicent does explain that the explosion of Rot in her is worse after she takes out the needle. Almost as if it's been building up inside them all this time. I paused to even tell you, but I took out the needle myself. The Scarlet Rot writhes now, worse than ever. So it's pretty clear that this is where the final moments of the battle took place, and we even find Clean Rot Knights able to rise outside when you're near, even now. But then, we don't find Redan anywhere near here. Instead, we find him closer to his former home at Redmayne Castle. In a nearby catacomb, the spirits of the war-dead actually continue to clash, refusing to surrender, even in death. And outside, Redan is exactly the same way. And while witless, he's still alive, even managing to keep the stars in stasis, even now. For he's still in possession of his Great Rune, which itself started to burn to resist the encroachment of the Scarlet Rot. His feet have rotten off, the spears of Clean Rot Knights remain in his flesh, but he fights on, simply using those spears in his back as arrows to fight off anyone who threatens him, refusing to give up and die in anything but an honorable death. Are you one for festivals? Or flowers? To the south, a grand festival to make the stars turn. To the east, a hardened body. To the east, a hardened bud of a flower to be. But dare you enter into the heart of the Scarlet Rot? As the Rot takes hold, Caled becomes a fresh hell, and the land itself becomes a threat. Even the dragons in this place were forced to flee, and they would make a new nest on a plateau that would be dubbed Dragon Barrow, and no one since then has dared to enter it. That said, a few dragons did not make it away unscathed. The dragon Exikis succumbed to the Scarlet Rot, though he did not forget his hatred, and sadly, Grail, the mother of all dragons, who dwarfs them all as well, can be found on Death's Door, surrounded by her children, and completely blighted by the Scarlet Rot. Kind of sad. Thanks for the 50k runes, though. And in the end, it was Melania's Scarlet Rot, not really Melania herself, that would eventually drive Redan's Redmane Knights to defeat. According to their armor, when they were driven to defeat by Melania's Scarlet Rot, the Redmane Knights burned off the crest on the left breast of their armor, to indicate their resolve, stating, Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again, for our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the Blight. The Knights using fire to burn away their own crest in this way is such a great symbol, for fire was their one and only weapon for fighting back against the Rot. And interestingly, according to the Armorer's Cookbook, a lot of these tools and techniques to do with fire were passed down by an Armorer. who served the great General Redan, as his books contain knowledge of dealing with Rot, the application of fire in particular. And so, this flame of the Redmanes clearly became a large part of their identity henceforth. Corpses of rabid wildlife were piled high and burned, long smoldering walls of flame were built in order to prevent the Rot from spreading to neighboring lands. These same walls border their own castles, they burnt down churches, and they even managed to commandeer some flame chariots to help in their fight. They utilized torches, firepots, arrows, everything. And fittingly, Knight Geron's beloved sword, a Flambeurge, became the symbol of the castle itself, thanks to the flame-like undulation that gives this sword its difficult-to-pronounce name. And Geron himself remained at Redmane Castle to regularly host a celebration of war, calling champions from far and wide to deliver death. A death for his friend, who is now festering with Rot, and crippled by madness, who now only wishes for an honorable way out. Meanwhile, amidst Melania's Aeonian butterflies, pale pests emerge from the swamp of Aeonia. And though they appear to be mere bugs, they're not. These creatures are intelligent, with a quote-unquote keen intellect that allows them to craft uncanny weaponry from a sharpened shell. They can encant spells as well, and they can even tame wild beasts. That said, they are ultimately creatures of worship, and Garry actually calls them witless, which admittedly does contrast with them being described as intelligent in this item description. Regardless, the pests are also called the Abandoned Children of the Goddess, and Servants of the Goddess of Rot, who have been forsaken. And it's not hard to see why. Not only was Melania carried far away at the very moment of her bloom when these pests allegedly emerged, but she resents and resists the Scarlet Rot inside her, unless she's pushed to the absolute brink. So, of course, these pests are abandoned in that sense as well, and who wouldn't hate them? Honestly, is there anything more annoying than this bloody attack? Nevertheless, the pests persist. They even have a quotable line of dialogue in the Kindred of Rot's exultation talisman, which reads, Rot for the Scarlet Goddess, O Scarlet Blossoms, flourish in distant lands, and return to us the unwanted children. Which brings us to the phrase, Scarlet Blossoms. This might not be talking about literal flower buds of the Scarlet Rot, but instead, I think it's talking about actual people. I think it's talking about these five sisters. I think these are the Scarlet Blossoms. They are Pollyanna, Maureen, Amy, Mary, and Millicent. Developed, waiting to flower into magnificence. What a wondrous day that will be. In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. She might very well outshine her sisters. So, it seems like these pests, including Gary, perhaps, have a keen interest in cultivating these Scarlet Blossoms. I'd prefer to talk about Millicent's questline in a future Prepare to Cry episode, so subscribe and turn on notifications, but I will hold off for now. But essentially, Gary does all of this in anticipation of these daughters becoming Scarlet Valkyries, who he believes might one day serve Melania when she ascends as the Goddess of Rot. At this point, Melania hadn't been seen for a long while. Not since she was carried off to the Heiligtree, and the Heiligtree's location itself was a mystery to many. But there were still those who venerated and worshipped her, and they weren't all pests. Some of them were human, like Malie Mirai, the castellan of the Shaded Castle. Malie wears the Mirai mask, which is something only worn by the head of House Mirai. It bears the likeness of the first of their line, and it describes this long, dual history of the Mirai family, who served as both executioners and castellans of the Shaded Castle. So fittingly, their storied sword is the Mirai Executioner's Sword, a broad-bladed weapon that would eventually be used against them. For one day, they made the mistake of capturing a bell-bearing hunter named Elema. But Elema, who knew battle skills that allowed him to move objects with his very own will, snatched the sword from the sight of his looming execution and overthrew his captors. But it doesn't seem like he wanted to rule over the castle in their stead. Instead, the castle falls into ruin, and when we find him, Elema is just standing and staring at an enormous portrait, which is a picture of Melania, who some believe is to blame for the fate of the castle. A nearby phantom laments the state of things, and states, House Mirai is ruined. Just desserts for falling for that severed harpy. No surprise that guilty cretin took the castle and our storied sword. In the outskirts of the castle, you can actually find and fight Malie Mirai, the former castellan of the castle, who has now been ousted. He wields the Antspur Rapier, which is a weapon that evokes the Scorpion Dagger that we mentioned at the start of the video as it's also a blade fashioned from a chitinous creature. In this case, it's the spur of a giant ant. Fittingly then, its description reminds us that Scarlet Rot is an old legend, and goes on to state that Malie Mirai of the Shaded Castle was a private believer in the Scarlet Rot, and indeed, he eventually found his own personal goddess. The Mirai robe explains why he was so enamored with her, stating that the sons of House Mirai are all sickly born, and so Malie Mirai was beguiled by the beautiful and fierce goddess who was born into Rot. Melania was, after all, a powerful and fierce figure in spite of her affliction, so it's easy to see why Malie Mirai looked up to her. Though I guess it's possible that he took this veneration too far, as the castle is found sinking into a poison swamp, and the throne room is filled with prosthetics which mirror Melania's own. Indeed, it's possible that he even found Melania's very own prosthetic, as you can loot the Valkyrie's prosthesis here, which reads, Golden prosthesis once used by the one-armed Valkyrie, a masterwork of craftsmanship. With practice and skill, it can be used as proficiently as a real arm. When Malie Mirai, lord of the Shaded Castle, embraced this prosthesis, he claimed to feel the presence of his personal goddess. Now, I'm not really sure if this is Melania's actual prosthesis or not. I feel like you could make debates for and against that, but regardless, it drives home just how much of a fanboy this guy was. But in the end, the castle is not much more now than just a home for some surviving clean-rot knights who would understandably feel at home in such a place. And I guess they have nowhere else to go as Melania slumbers back at the Heiligtree, where she does very little else until you arrive and trigger what I think is her second transformation. Now, I got some bad news for you guys in this final chapter. So, you know how difficult Melania was to defeat, right? Well, what if I told you that wasn't her final form? It might not be, for the Scarlet Aeonia description reads, each time the Scarlet Flower blooms, Melania's rot advances, and with the third bloom, she will become a true goddess. So, it's known that Melania's first bloom was in Caled, and we know that she blooms in a fight against us, so the debate becomes, is this mid-fight bloom Melania's second bloom, or her third? Some would argue that this is Melania's third bloom, and that she's already become the goddess of rot. She does, after all, literally have goddess of rot as her title, and there is a bloom right outside her boss room which could have been the site of her second bloom. So, how do you argue against that? Well, for starters, the bloom outside might not be hers. For one, it'd be kind of weird if she had a second bloom that is never described, right here, when she's slumbering in just the neighboring room. But not only that, in front of this bloom, you actually loot the Traveler's Set, which is the same set worn by Millicent and her sisters, and Melania as well. Considering Millicent and her sisters are buds of Melania, and considering Millicent also leaves behind one of these blooms when she dies, it's not ridiculous to think that one of these sisters might have flowered here already. And I don't think that Melania having goddess of rot in her boss title means that much. Many, like Gowri and the pests, already believe that Melania is the goddess of rot. The Scarlet Aeonia description instead specifies that the third bloom will make her a true goddess, and I think anything before that is just a brief flash of the rot god shining through. But the biggest piece of evidence that Melania hasn't yet reached her third bloom yet, in my opinion, comes from Gowri, who goes to extraordinary lengths to nurture Millicent, encouraging us to kill her even, just so this betrayal can turn her into a Scarlet Valkyrie that will serve Melania. It must be done by your hand, no other. Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact. Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly. When Melania ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn as a Scarlet Valkyrie. If Millicent dies, she flowers, with Gowri's expectation being that she will be revived after this. So considering that there's a bloom in Melania's boss room as well that appears after you defeat her, I feel like it's possible that Melania could have another revivification after this as well. And one final piece of evidence was actually pointed out by you guys in the comments of my recent Oracle short. In that video, I argued that the Oracles might be there to herald the return of Mikla as a god, as their spirit ashes state that it is said that when Oracle Envoys appear playing their pipes, they do so to herald the arrival of a new god or age. But I completely neglected to mention that they might be here to herald Melania's ascension as a god instead. So, thank you guys for pointing that out. If you haven't already, I'd appreciate if you tried out some of my short content. It's extremely difficult to fit everything within 60 seconds, but it's a fun challenge and I'm pretty happy with some of the short stories that I've been able to tell in those shorts. Anyway, personally, I wouldn't be surprised if we fight some incarnation of Melania again in the DLC, and I'd be down for that fight provided she rises again with her lower half as a scorpion or something. But what I find- to be the most disturbing thought about Melania's potential third bloom, is that Gowrie believes a Scarlet Bloom will be more vivid if it's nurtured by betrayal. That's what we see in Millicent's questline. So, what if Melania's third bloom could be more vivid if she's betrayed by her brother, Michaela? But it's late now, and I'm really getting into some deranged speculation territory, aren't I? So, that's probably my cue to end the video. Special thanks to Mispap for the footage and editing help, as always. And special thanks to Quelaag as well for looking over this script. And thank you, as always, for watching.\n",

      "[Doc 11: The Lore of Elden Ring's Dragons]\n",
      "So you've become the Elden Lord, but before you, it was Radagon, and before him, it was Godfrey, who items call the first Elden Lord. And yet, even before Godfrey, there was another. Placidusax, an ancient dragon who ruled as Elden Lord in the prehistoric age before the Ode Tree. It's him and his kin that you're going to be learning about in this video. But to quickly summarize, first, there were the ancient dragons who had these stone scales that could twist time, making them essentially immortal. And yet, some ancient dragons can be found dead, buried in the rocks of Faraam Azula, which twists and crumbles in an eternal storm. On the ground, their descendants roamed the lands between without the stone scales of their ancestors, and instead of stone scales, they've inherited aspects of their environments. The ice dragons roamed the icy mountaintops, the glintstone dragons feasted on sorcerers. One's hatred was so strong that he even endured the scarlet rot in Caelod. And it's here in Caelod that Graol, mother of all the mortal dragons, lies dying. There's a lot to talk about. This is the story of Elden Ring's dragons. Many item descriptions note that the age of the ancient dragons was prehistoric. And I think that's an important word because it might explain why Godfrey's recorded title is the first Elden Lord, even though he's not. Placidusax is. The word prehistoric denotes a period of time before written history, and while there are spoken legends from this time, I think what they're trying to get across is that the Elden Lord before Godfrey wouldn't be well known. This was before the age of the Erd Tree, after all, and the Erd Tree would eventually come to be considered perfect and eternal. So the idea that there might have even been an Elden Lord that came before could have been considered irrelevant at best, and sacrilegious, I think, at worst. But what really is an Elden Lord, and why was Placidusax considered one? I feel like the role of Elden Lord can be roughly narrowed down to three things. You are made eligible by A, your strength, B, your validity as a consort, and or C, your willingness to bring about a new age or order. Specifically, the Elden Lord is tasked with bringing about the Greater Will's order, one built around the Elden Ring that it sent here long ago, hence the name Elden Lord. Sounds simple, but then, remember, the nature of the Greater Will's order can vary wildly, as is shown by all who come to champion it over the ages. The Greater Will's order is malleable enough that it can even accept a number of endings that our Tarnished brings about, where the Elden Ring is mended by runes that will dramatically redefine the world. So it is that our role as a Tarnished is actually pretty unique, as our primary goal now is to reunite the broken shards of the Elden Ring with Marika, the god that is the vessel of the Elden Ring locked away inside the Ode Tree. It's not up to her to will a new age into being, it's up to us, and we have to gather the great runes to do this. So it is that in most endings, you ascend the throne as Elden Lord alone, without a god or living consort by your side. Instead, your crumbling god is a vessel for your Elden Ring, and not much more. But previously, it seems an Elden Lord was chosen by their god, chosen for their strength, chosen to sire a lineage, chosen for their usefulness to their god's order. So it was that Hora-Lu was chosen to be the Elden Lord as the Age of the Ode Tree began. He defeated Marika's enemies, he sired the Golden Lineage, and then was discarded in favor of Radagon, an Elden Lord who betrayed Marika's enemies and sired more demigod children with her before being shattered alongside his god. And since we don't actually know much about Placidusax's god, we rely on Hora-Lu, and Radagon, and Marika as well to teach us the things that we should assume would have been traditionally true about her. So it is that Placidusax's god likely chose him as Elden Lord because Placidusax was powerful, politically expedient, loyal, and or perhaps a valid consort. And speaking of Elden Lords being consorts, it's certainly possible that Placidusax consorted with his god, but I don't think that means that all or any of the ancient dragons would have been the result of that union. In fact, as noted by Zully the Witch, the heads of Placidusax are different and are labeled as male and female respectively, so who's to say Placidusax didn't spawn their own ancient dragons? Whatever the case, the ancient dragons were exceptionally loyal to their lord, and multiple item descriptions state that the ancient dragons who ruled the prehistoric era before the Erd Tree would protect their lord as a wall of living rock. This is why the shape of the dragon has become symbolic of all manner of protections, and indeed, we commonly see dragons on shields and on damage reduction talismans. But even without his kin laying down their lives to protect him, Placidusax is intensely powerful in their own right. In fact, I'd say that Placidusax was likely chosen as Elden Lord for their strength in battle, and the physical evidence of battle is all there. Their form is severely scarred, and even his heads have been severed in unknown fights. I think it's fair to speculate that Placidusax put their life on the line for their god, just as Elden Lords would do for their gods in years to come, and just as his ancient dragons did for him. But what exactly is an ancient dragon? To help us distinguish between all of the dragons in the game, it's important to note that not all dragons in Elden Ring are of the ancient variety. Most are actually lesser wyverns like these. Though they're all descended from the same stock, ancient dragons specifically are characterized by their mastery of red lightning, as well as their four wings, four limbs, and stone scales. These stone scales are perhaps their most defining characteristic. You would have found these stone scales in your playthrough. They would have been looted as gravel stones, which are said to be the scales of the ancient dragons. These gravel stones can be used to craft Dragonwound Grease, a weapon buff that increases the damage you deal to dragons. It reads, when the dragons were born from their ancient kin, they lost their stone scales, which can now be used to cause them mortal harm. Talk about insult to injury. So just like in Dark Souls, it's these stone scales that gave the ancient dragons their signature immortality. And as further evidence for that fact, consider the Dragon King's Cragblade, which reveals that today's dual-winged, two-legged dragons are considered paltry and mortal. Again confirming that the ancient dragons were immortal by way of comparison. But why are they immortal? Well, the mechanism behind this immortality is revealed by the ancient dragon Smithingstone's description, which marks it as a golden gravel stone and a scale of the ancient dragon lord. Most importantly though, it reads, this stone lightly twists time. Therefore, it's Plisigius Axe's very scales, and likely also those of his kin, that have time-twisting properties, explaining the ancient dragon's longevity. It seems they're immune to the effects of time. This also explains why Plisigius Axe's old lord's talisman messes with time, lengthening the duration of sorceries and incantations in the hands of the tarnished. Most interesting though, is that the Smithingstone goes on to state that it allows for the creation of a weapon capable of slaying a god. Presumably, this is because of the scales' time-twisting abilities, which I theorize might help to sort of undo the god that gets smacked with this from existing in the first place. Maybe time undoes them in that way, or perhaps it speeds up their eventual irrelevancy over time. It's really fitting that a god would be weak to time and nothing else, really. Now, scales' twisting time is one thing, but all of Faramazula seems to exist outside of time, to some extent. There is no day and night cycle here, for example, and this time-twisting effect is particularly strong in Plisigius Axe's arena, which you access by lying down at the very edge of his storm. In a way, you kind of become a part of the environment here in this moment, as the space you're lying in is actually a shallow grave meant for entombment. It's just missing a skeleton, whereas the other graves have them, and now that you're part of Faramazula itself, time stops, then actually begins to bring you backwards in time, with the repairing ruins to Plisigius Axe's forum, where the dragon lord once dwelled eternally beyond time. So, time is extremely convoluted in Plisigius Axe's arena, and I say this because it's here, in the heart of the storm beyond time, that you're able to use an item called Michaela's Needle, which is one of the unalloyed gold needles that Michaela crafted to ward away the meddling of Outer Gods. Now, currently, this needle is only a temporary solution. It only wards off the Outer Gods' influence. It doesn't cure one of it, as Melania is evidence of. Indeed, the final silver version of the needle reveals that the needle is still, as yet, unfinished, and can only be used in the heart of the storm beyond time, said to be found in Faramazula. It's here alone that the needle does finally function fully, removing the entire influence of the Outer God in your body. Michaela originally intended to use this needle to repel the Outer God of Rot within his sister, but here, if you're locked into the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending, you can use the needle to cheat fate and undo the Frenzy God's influence instead. This reveals that the final missing component of the needle is time. It just needs this final time-twisting effect to be complete. So, as with the Smithing Stones we just mentioned, perhaps you are inserting the needle at a point before the Outer God's influence existed upon you, or perhaps the gods are simply, again, weak to time's effects. I wonder if Michaela knew this. I wonder if he knew that time-twisting was what was needed to complete the needle, and I wonder if he even realized that this is a place you could come to do that. Anyway, the one weird thing about Michaela's needle is that you can use it in Placidusax's arena, even though he's dead. Raising the question, you know, hang on, if it's Placidusax's scales that twist time, why is it time is being twisted here in a location, even without him and his scales present? Now, I do have a theory that might reconcile this issue. Remember how I brought up that time only starts moving backwards when you lie down in a burial space and become a part of the environment? Well, my theory is that what if it's the landmass of Varamazula itself that also twists time? I think it might be able to do this because the landmass literally has ancient dragons and their time-twisting scales entombed within it. The official art book reveals a ton of these ancient dragons, and indeed, ancient dragons can be found within Varamazula's geological stratum. I asked data miner Zully the Witch to take a closer look at these assets, and she discovered that there are two variants of these entombed dragons that show up here, here, here, and here. So four dragons in total that we can see, at least. At first, I thought that these might represent Plisigisax's missing heads, but the intact variant of the model displays four wings and four legs, meaning these were entire ancient dragons. That said, they don't look entirely like ancient dragons. In fact, their heads are actually the same as Plisigisax's, albeit rendered in a lower level of detail. So personally, given the information I have, I believe that this suggests that these entombed dragons might be Plisigisax's offspring, or kin. Perhaps even an older generation of ancient dragon, entombed in a previous geological stratum of Varamazula's ancient history. So it is that I think you can argue that the landmass of Varamazula itself can twist time. But additionally, or alternatively, Varamazula's storm itself might represent this time twisting. Michaela's Needle does say that it can only be used in the heart of the storm in Varamazula. So perhaps Plisigisax's golden scales sort of twisted a storm into being, and maybe that storm twists time irrespective of whether Plisigisax is alive or not. Also, I really like the idea that twisting storms are a visual representation of the scales that twist time, because the scales do specifically use the word twist in regards to time. So the storm and these twisting hurricanes are so perfect visually for that. But as we move into the next chapter, I want to point out one more interesting thing about these golden scales, and it's that according to their item descriptions, they're only made into stones after being polished, and thanks to their older item description text in version 1.0 of Elden Ring, we know exactly who it was that polished these stones in the first place. They were refined by sentient beasts that regarded them as holy relics. So it is that we arrive at the beastmen of Varamazula, who were the ancient dragons clergymen, worshipers, and lesses. 🎵 There are a few types of beastmen in Varamazula, but most wield their signature curved sword, a weapon that is forged from dull iron, but is so well designed that despite its weight, it's comparatively easy to wield for the damage it delivers. This skill in smithing seems to extend to their throne weapons as well, which boomerang through the air towards you like nothing else in the lands between. As the beastman cleaver itself states, it's clear the beastmen possess knowledge beyond human ken. As you start to progress towards the latter half of Varamazula, you'll start to be assailed by red lightning, wielded by the beastman clergy. Some warriors even carry weapons blessed with its effects. This is significant because red lightning is explicitly called the weapon wielded by the ancient dragons. Lightning in FromSoftware games has always been a weapon of divinity, and those that wield it are naturally the blessed adherents of that divinity. In this case, the divines were the ancient dragons who wielded this lightning within the storms of Varamazula. So, for the beastmen to wield it, the art was probably taught to them. For additional context, one of the only other characters who wields a weapon imbued with red lightning is Vyke, a tarnished beloved by an ancient dragon. Indeed, certain beastmen were quote-unquote chosen or blessed in a similar way, with the Azula beastman spirit ashes stating that Varamazula's giant mausoleum was guarded by chosen beastmen who wield weapons clad in lightning. For more evidence of the beastmen's reverence of ancient dragons, we can look to the five sites of grace in Varamazula that mark different sections of the Dragon Temple, a sprawling place of worship that features multiple statues of beast clergymen, bent in reverence towards ancient dragon statues. And the central part of the Dragon Temple is this, the place where you would have fought the godskin duo, an altar overshadowed by an enormous dragon skeleton. For reference, these skeletal remains dwarf even Placigious axe, and are matched only in size by the dragon Grail and the ancient dragon Gransax. Both of whom, we'll discuss a little bit later. The Azula Beastman Spirit Ashes state that Faram Azula is said to be the remains of a giant mausoleum enshrining an ancient dragon. And, given this dragon's prominent placement in the Dragon Temple of all places, I actually think the enshrined dragon in question might be this one. Though, you could certainly make the argument that the enshrined ancient dragon was Plisigious Axe instead. But regardless of exactly what it's enshrining, Faram Azula really is just a huge mausoleum, with burial customs literally around every corner. Considering all the jars in this place, one such type of burial that comes to mind is jar burial, a practice documented in ancient human cultures all across the globe. Now, this practice would show up more explicitly later in Olden Ring's timeline, with the living jars, which are literally filled with the interred remains of powerful warriors. But, beyond the powerful funerary imagery in Faram Azula, there's actually no explicit evidence that I can find that suggests actual entombment within these jars. In contrast, the Beastman's jar shield is quite clear, that the Beastmen have always fired earthenware jars for the express purpose of making shields. The description comments that these ways are strange. And I feel like I can offer a strange theory here. We know that the Beastmen value golden stone scales, right? And we know that there are literally ancient dragons entombed within the earth of Faram Azula. So what if the Beastmen value the dragon-infused earth for this reason? Firing pots from this dragon earth in an initial burial custom, then breaking them to use as sacred shields. We established earlier that the golden scaled ancient dragons are a symbol of protection, and considering these are earthenware shields that are flecked with the same golden hue as their scales, I feel like this theory is alright. It's the only way I can rationalize making shields out of pots that are made out of earth anyway. Somewhat predictably, the Beastmen practice entombment of their own species as well. And I'm not just talking about their gold adorned tombs, I'm talking about their entombment in the architecture itself as well. The skeletal remains of the Beastmen frequently show up within the architecture of Faram Azula itself. This reminds me of the historical practice of immurement, which was this sort of horrific form of capital punishment, usually, where the subject was entombed in a structure while alive. That said, there are historical examples of immurement being more about human sacrifice, a part of a grand burial ceremony in some cultures, and believed to make buildings sturdier in others. And I feel like it would have been the Beastmen who built the architecture of Faram Azula, not the dragons themselves. It is structured to be a mausoleum, after all, and since it's the Beastmen who revere the ancient dragons, it's naturally the Beastmen who would have occupied the labor roles in society. That said, I guess humans also could have built it, since humans are depicted in the architectural reliefs of Faram Azula, so it stands to reason that humans were a part of this culture as well, even at this early prehistoric period of time, which is kind of crazy considering how much humans contrast with the Beastmen here. As with a lot of the architecture in FromSoftware games, I feel like it would be a bit dishonest of me not to mention that these in particular are reused assets, also present in Bloodborne. So, it's possible that FromSoftware didn't expect us to read into these assets too hard, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they at least wanted to suggest that there was a human presence in Faram Azula once. So, not only were humans present, but they were worthy of being enshrined. Who were they? Well, our biggest clues about different types of humans comes from origin text in the character creation screen, and there are two human types in particular that I think might be a match for the humans in these reliefs. First are the Numen. The Numen are supposed descendants of denizens of another world, and the Numen's rune tells us that the Numen are said to have come from outside the lands between. Considering Faram Azula experienced a cultural revolution with the coming of the Greater Will and the Elden Ring, which arrived upon an extraterrestrial star, I wouldn't be surprised if Numenoid humans came along for the ride as well. Alternatively, the character creator reveals lore for the stony face of the people of the Ancient Dragons, among whom life is typically short. It certainly seems to be suggesting that these humans are descended from the Ancient Dragons, why else would it note their stony faces, or their short lives in contrast to the Ancients? As we'll discover later, Ancient Dragons can turn into humans, so perhaps they intermingled at some point in the past to create these humans? That said, this is all just speculation, and a human presence on Faram Azula is otherwise quite hard to process, considering the beasts are clearly the legacy of Faram Azula. For it was the beasts who would gain intelligence and shape the world around them, not humans. Ancient historians have long speculated that it was the development of long opposable thumbs that helped facilitate early humans' use of tools. Similarly, in Elden Ring, having five fingers is something to be celebrated, as is revealed by the Cinque Deia, a weapon of the beast clergymen. This item description is one of those ones that is just hugely significant for the lore. The name Cinque Deia means five fingers, and it visually shows five skeletal fingers on the blade. The item description goes on to state that the design celebrates a beast's five fingers, symbolic of the intelligence once granted upon their kind. So before there were beastmen, there were simply beasts here. And it was the bestowal of intelligence, which is equated with having five fingers, that led to the beastmen. This of course begs the question, who or what bestowed intelligence upon the beastmen? And luckily, it's a simple one to answer. It was the Greater Will. The Greater Will is all about fingers. It speaks through the two fingers, it hates if you have three fingers, it will tolerate four fingers, but five is the amount to be celebrated. Or at least, it was long ago. And if this veneration of fingers wasn't enough evidence for you, well the 1.0 version of the Cinque Deia literally states that it was the Greater Will who granted the beast's intelligence. So, that's that. The Greater Will clearly also has a bit of a thing for acting through beasts. Just look at the final boss, it's an Elden Beast. One that the Greater Will sent hurtling into the lands between, so that it could later become the Elden Ring. And in this prehistoric period, the ancient dragons would be graced by the Greater Will first, with the beastmen later being granted intelligence as well. All the better to revere the ancient dragons with. According to bestial incantations, stones were the first weapons of the beasts who had gained intelligence. And having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold. Of course, this is yet another example where the Greater Will takes away wildness or chaos in favor of order. It seems to care little what form that order takes, it only cares that some order takes hold. Preferably taking hold with a full, five-fingered fist. In-game, the five-fingered Cinque Deia is wielded by Garank, the beast clergyman. According to the weapon, it is only given to high-ranking clergymen of Haramazula, marking Garank as one of their number. Presumably, this means he is, or was, a clergyman of the ancient dragon faith before being repurposed by the Greater Will, becoming a shadow for Marika instead. After all, when we encounter him in-game, the age of the ancient dragons has long passed, yet he still achieves relevancy in this age, in yet another subservient role as is common to all beasts, except this time it's to Marika, and this time he is a shadow of the Empyrean, which is a topic we should touch on next. We first meet Garank at the Bestial Sanctum, a place in Caled that bears a striking resemblance to Haramazula. There's even a bridge down the way called Farum Greatbridge, with a dragon defending it, no less. These are no mere ruins that have fallen from the sky. This architecture is intact, and must have been built for and by the beasts at some point after they received intelligence. We'll get into that point a little bit later, but for now, let's focus on Garank. We first learn about Garank from his bestial incantations, which are given to us when we hand him Deathroot. Long ago, Garank was a beast of such terrifying ferocity that his former name meant Death of the Demigods. This former name in question was Malaketh, a new name to suit his new purpose, which was to seal away the rune of destined death for Marika, who was his Empyrean. So, first he was Garank. Then, as the Age of the Ancient Dragons ended, and Marika became a force in the world, Garank became known as Malaketh instead, who was, and I quote, a shadowbound beast given to his Empyrean, who was Marika. Marika had one job for Malaketh, and that was to lock away destined death. To a degree, he fails at this task, and a fragment of destined death is stolen, becoming the Deathroot that spreads throughout the lands. So it is that Garank has returned to the lands between now, and is trying desperately to scrape together all the Deathroot in the world. The Beastclaw incantation talks about his present identity, as this spell represents the fury of Garank, his bestial nature returned as much as it does his restless agitation. But after realizing his mission is impossible, Garank peaces out, and then we're only able to find him in one place alone, Faramazula, where he has ascended with a draconic tree sentinel as his defender. Here, he sort of exists outside of time, defending what remains of destined death within his very own flesh. It's easy to get confused about when Garank exists in the game, so apologies for skipping over this topic quickly, but this video is about dragons after all, and the main thing I really want to get across here is just how much the beasts have been repurposed to suit the needs of the Greater Will. First, it gave them intelligence, and then they served the Ancient Dragon's order. But then, when the Ancient Dragon's age ended, beasts like Garank were given new purpose, commonly as shadowbound entities, compelled to serve order once more. Whatever form their Imperians dictated that order should take. The Raging Wolf set states that, according to the old legends, wolves are the shadows of the Imperian. It's certainly possible that this legend originated in Faramazula. There is, after all, a statue that features three wolves deferring to a human woman. It might be a stretch to assume that this is depicting wolves as shadows of the Imperian, but I thought I'd mention it, at least. Again, in case you've forgotten, an Imperian is basically one of the Greater Will's candidates for godhood. And in Marika and Ranni's case, at least, they were granted wolves as their shadows. Wolves who evolved to be man's best friend, as they say, are defined as such because of their loyalty. And as stated by the Beast Champion Helm, the beasts, their eyes and ears covered, represent an oath. See nothing, hear nothing, doubt nothing, and carry on along the path set in stone. And so it is that Garank and Blythe are wolves completely loyal to their Imperians, dedicated to protecting their lords, just like the ancient dragons of old. This loyalty to the Greater Will and also their Imperians causes this fantastic tension within these characters. In the case of Garank, he was loyal to Marika, but now lives impatiently with this impossible task of having to recover every piece of Deathroot. And in the case of Blythe, his loyalty to Ranni eventually forces him to betray the Two Fingers, in complete defiance of the fate that he was born to. Speaking of which, Blythe is quite unique from Garank. Unlike Garank, he has no apparent ties to Faramazula. After all, unlike Garank, he was created to be Ranni's Imperian and grew up with her in a more modern age that was far removed from Faramazula's. Perhaps this is why Blythe takes on a much more human form. Blythe was created in a much more modern age than the beasts of old, so it seems the Two Fingers skipped a lot of the history and simply created Blythe in a more half-man image, creating him from scratch, as opposed to his forebears. The other beast worth mentioning here is Sarosh, the ethereal beast-regent given to Godfrey to weigh down his ceaseless lust for battle. Of course, Godfrey is Elden Lord, not an Imperian. Just so, Sarosh is not a wolf, but a lion. Like Garank, he has a longer history, and according to the Beastclaw Greathammer, at one point a lord of beasts, with black nails protruding from golden fur. To quote the Champion's set, beasts are drawn to champions and to lords, and this holds true for the Beastmen drawn to Sarosh, and in the future it would hold true for Sarosh himself, a beast that became Lord Godfrey's regent, intended to guide him and his golden lineage, so Sarosh was drawn to Godfrey as well. But no matter who the beasts were loyal to, whether it was to their beast lords, or to the ancient dragons, or then Elden Lords or Imperians, throughout all of this, they were always following a deeper loyalty. A loyalty to the Greater Will, and its ancient Elden Ring. The Elden Ring This Elden Ring looks very different. For one, it appears to have many more circlets, many more great runes than the modern Elden Ring. Considering its placement in Farrar Mazula, a place from long ago, I speculate that this is an ancient variant of the Elden Ring, a depiction of it back during the era of the ancient dragons. What's more, this ancient Elden Ring has what appear to be roots snaking down and descending from it. This is in contrast to the modern Elden Ring, which has this latticed pattern instead. The latticed pattern is most commonly seen as a symbol of Radagon, an Elden rune that is visible on his statues and his scar seal as well. I always thought that the latticed pattern might represent Radagon's efforts to sort of stitch the Elden Ring back together when it was shattered, and we'll speculate on what the roots might mean a little bit later as well. As for why the Elden Ring looks different though, well, it makes sense that the Elden Ring would have changed throughout the ages. We know the thing is malleable, after all. There are examples of runes being taken out of it and put back into it, depending on the specific needs of the god who acts as a vessel for its power, or the needs of the tarnished who will become Elden Lord, via great runes, or even via mending runes. The vessel of the Elden Ring we know, in the modern era, is Marika. She literally has the Elden Ring entombed within her. But back to the story. Back in the age before the Ode Tree, the Elden Ring would have had a different vessel, a different god. And unfortunately, all we know about them is that they abandoned Placidusax, who was their Elden Lord. The Remembrance of the Dragon Lord reads, The Dragon Lord, whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time, is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Ode Tree. Once his god was fled, the Lord continued to await its return. I'm assuming that his god had a female aspect, considering all the other Empyreans and gods in Elden Ring do. So it is that when we find Placidusax, he is in a state of eternal maidenlessness. And who knows how long Placidusax has been waiting for his god to return. In fact, one community theory I love, that I've seen put forward a few times, is that Placidusax's pose is similar to that of the Two Fingers, after you were rejected by the Ode Tree. In case you forgot, it's at this stage that Enya says the Two Fingers have taken up this pose because they're busy consulting with the Greater Will. Just so, the same might be true of Placidusax, who has also been spurned by his god and the Greater Will, and is trying, perhaps, to commune with them. To take this analogy further, Placidusax has two heads now, but data recently uncovered by Zully the Witch suggests that he once had five, not unlike how the Two Fingers once came from a full five-fingered hand. That said, the Old Lord's talisman depicts Placidusax with four heads. To reconcile this contradiction, maybe we can just think that he had four heads when this talisman was made, perhaps? Anyway, not a big deal. What is a big deal is Placidusax's god, who represents this huge blind spot for us in Elden Ring's lore. We don't know who they were, we don't know what powers they had, and we don't know when or why they left, or what age they really wanted to bring about. As such, I'll be calling them the Nameless God from this point forwards. Whoever they were, all we know for certain is that they once saw Placidusax as a valid Elden Lord, so they might have been all about the Age of the Ancient Dragons once. However, I feel like it says more about this god that they fled this age, and abandoned their loyal Elden Lord. This reminds me a lot of what Marika did to her Elden Lord, Godfrey, exiling and abandoning him after he had won her wars and outlived his usefulness. Though, at least with Godfrey, Marika had a secret plan for her Elden Lord and his tarnished kin to return. On the other hand, Placidusax was abandoned, and has waited for an eternity, only to die at the hands of our tarnished. So whoever his god was, I feel like they really did abandon him entirely. The Greater Will's gods are the vessels of the Elden Ring, and Placidusax's nameless god jumping ship with the Elden Ring would have surely represented an enormous upheaval to what became crumbling Faramizula. Speaking of which, I still haven't really explained how it became crumbling Faramizula. Many descriptions state that Faramizula has been crumbling since time immemorial, and it's for this reason that you can find tiny ruin fragments, and enormous ones too, scattered all over the lands between. This is better explained by the description of one such ruin fragment, which was honed into a weapon, called the Ruin's Greatsword. This is one of the legendary armaments, originally rubble from a ruin which fell from the sky. The ruin it came from crumbled when struck by a meteorite. As such, this weapon harbours its destructive power. So meteorites with destructive power are these purple spells in Elden Ring. And indeed, this weapon's skill is waves of destruction, which manifests as purple energy. A meteorite crashed into Faramizula, and that meteorite was purple, and imbued the ruins with a sort of gravitational magic. But beyond that, there's not really much we know about this meteorite. We don't even know if it struck Faramizula when it was a city on the ground, lifting the city into the sky with gravitational magic, or if it struck Faramizula while it was already skybound, crashing into the city while it was in midair. So much of Faramizula's history is hidden from us. This meteorite might even be the same meteorite as others mentioned in Elden Ring's lore. Because lots of meteorites have made landfall in the lands between before. Some brought the Onyx Lords, a race of ancients with skin of stone who rose to life when a meteor struck. A creature called Astel may have brought himself down on a meteorite and destroyed an entire eternal city. A golden star even once bore the Elden Beast and the Elden Ring into the lands between in the first place. Thus, you could speculate that any one of these, or even a different one entirely, laid waste to Faramizula. Again, you could even speculate that it was this meteor that imbued Faramizula's ruins with gravitational energy, lifting it into the sky. Not unlike how the earth in Limgrave is lifted into the sky after being hit by a meteorite. And so perhaps, similarly, Faramizula's world was lifted higher into the sky, twisting in place, also thanks to the stone scales of the ancient dragons. Whatever the case, as Faramizula crumbled and twisted in the sky, ruin fragments rained down upon the entire lands between, some large and some small. Incidentally, these ruin fragments glow with a faint light from within, and are conducive to blessings from the two and three fingers respectively. That's what warming stones and frenzy flame stones are, they are pieces of ruin fragments imbued with power and light. And this makes a lot of sense, because these ruins are a part of the royal city that the greater will itself once graced. So, naturally, parts of its ruins are very conducive to the effects of the two and three fingers. Anyway, we don't know many other details behind Faramizula's ruin, but whatever the case, it's probably fair to say that this meteorite dealt an enormous blow to their culture. It might have even coincided with their god fleeing the city. And whenever this nameless god did leave, I think it's important to speculate on where they went next. After the Age of the Dragonlord, the Age of the Erdtree began. But before the Age of the Erdtree began, we learn that there was first a Crucible of Life, a primordial crucible where all life was once blended together. According to Siluria's Crucible Tree Helm, this crucible was the primordial form of the Erdtree, a manifestation of the Erdtree's primal vital energies. So, over the next few minutes, I'm going to try and argue that the Crucible became rooted quite literally, quite physically, in the Great Tree Roots that we find underneath the Lands Between. I don't think it's a coincidence that the ancient Elden Ring of Faramizula is burgeoning with roots. And after Faramizula's age ended, and its god absconded with an Elden Ring that is burgeoning with roots, I don't think it's a coincidence that a primordial crucible gave way to a Great Tree that would dominate the Lands Between. I think the Elden Ring physically left Faramizula, I think that led to the Crucible, which led to Great Tree Roots, which led to the Erdtree growing. The Elden Ring is, after all, the source of the Erdtree, and this should have been true for the ancient Elden Ring as well, which would have birthed this tree. As an additional piece of evidence that the Elden Ring is at the source of the Erdtree, we can look to the engraving on the stone door of the Erdtree itself, which shows the Elden Ring literally at the roots of the Erdtree, its source below the surface. Perhaps the Elden Ring wasn't rooted in the earth, while Faramizula was floating up in the sky, but eventually, it seems, it would be. According to the Gilded Greatshield, and Ordovus' greatsword, the colour of the Erdtree's primordial crucible was red, or perhaps more accurately, red tinged with gold. The red tinge in the gold coat mirrors the primordial matter that became the Erdtree, the colour of homeward yearning. This red tint exemplifies the nature of primordial gold, said to be close in nature to life itself. This colour is also seen in root resin, a secretion from roots that were once connected to the Great Tree. These two items, taken together, tie the Red of the Crucible to Great Tree roots quite well. And if that wasn't enough, Crucible, Knight Seluria, spends her exile amidst these roots, with a spear and a helm that have Great Tree ornamentation, that is modelled on the Crucible. I've seen people speculate that the Crucible isn't a physical place, and that it was just a crucible of competition instead, where different creatures battled against each other. And I think this misconception might be due to the original description of the Old Fang in version 1.0 of Elden Ring, which reads, In times long past, life was a crucible of competition. However, the item description was quickly patched to remove all mention of competition, and the patched description instead suggests that multiple overlapping fangs might be a vestige of the primordial crucible. So considering this updated description, and all of the colour and mention of primordial matter, I think FromSoft are certainly trying to suggest that the Crucible had a real physicality to it. And the Crucible has long been a topic plagued by confusing and perhaps mistranslated item descriptions. Take the aspects of the Crucible, which say that the Crucible was once a place where all life was once blended together. The Japanese instead clarifies that once life was blended together, which to me suggests the Crucible was a blending of existing life in the lands between, rather than a source of all life. And I think there's more evidence that this ancient Elden Ring of Faramazula was already kind of laying the groundwork for the Crucible. For example, we know from the Omen and Misbegotten that creatures of the Crucible are characterised by chaotic growth, considered aspects of devolution in the modern era. These are aspects of wings, horns, scales, feathers, and fangs. Just so, Plisigisax actually has tons of random fang growths around their maw, and later dragons even sprout feathers, another aspect of devolution. If that wasn't enough, remember, the dragon's lightning is red, tinted with gold as well, which is the same colour of the Primordial Crucible as we just discussed. Thus, I think it's safe to say that the colour and other aspects of the Primordial Crucible were already kind of present in the ancient dragons, the oldest of those graced by the Elden Ring that we know of. So with that, we've essentially laid the groundwork for a theory that I'd like to shout out from Loki, who is one of FromSoftware's most dedicated theory crafters. In this theory, he speculates on the identity of the Dragon Lord's fled god, and I think this theory is special because it manages to reconcile a couple of major loose ends in the game's lore along the way. As the theory goes, the Erd Tree was created as a by-product of the nameless god's death. Loki's initial reasoning is that after we die, runes are left behind in our wake, manifesting as small golden saplings. Therefore, since the Elden Ring itself is made up of a gargantuan amount of runes, surely the Elden Ring would sprout an enormous tree if the god vessel carrying it were to die. One thing I'll add to this theory is that our golden saplings only remain so if the mass of runes is not claimed. Just so, if no one knew that the nameless god had died, perhaps the Elden Ring's mass of runes was left to its own devices, to grow, as Loki posits, as a resilient, protective vessel, a firmly rooted tree that welcometh no man. And indeed, the nameless god did flee, not even telling her Elden Lord, Placidusax, where they had gone. Thus, their runes might have gone unclaimed. Directly below the Erd Tree are the deep root depths, where the Erd Tree might have once been planted, so to speak. One of the lesser known paths leads to this wall, an illusory wall, that reveals the Cathedral of the Forsaken, the Frenzied Merchants, and the Three Fingers of Frenzy. One of the strangest items down here is the fingerprint stone shield, which is, and I quote, part of the tomb of an ancient god. It's imprinted with an intricately carved fingerprint design, and these imprints are said to be the very seeds from which Frenzy first sprouted. Now at first glance, you'd think that the ancient god in question here would be the Three Fingers, who marked this great stone slab with fingerprints, and while I admit this stone grave could be for the outer god of Frenzied Flame, which manifests as the Three Fingers who are imprisoned down here, I much prefer the theory that this stone slab was the tomb of a different ancient god, one that was found and desecrated by the Three Fingers with their fingerprints, just as they desecrate the world with fingerprints in their ending. And that's exactly what Loki's theory proposes, that the Three Fingers desecrated a stone tomb of the Nameless God, Plisigisax's Queen, who had her final moments in this place. The Nameless God can also be used to reconcile another lore gap in Elden Ring, which is the identity of the corpse that makes up the Fingerslayer Blade. The Fingerslayer Blade is a blade said to have been born of a corpse, said to be able to harm the Greater Will and its vassals, the Two Fingers. The shape of this blade, featuring the arms of a corpse as a crossguard and culminating in a double helix, bears a striking resemblance to the Sacred Relic Sword, a weapon wrenched from the corpse of Radagon Marika. The Sacred Relic Sword is, and I quote, wrought from the remains of a god who should have lived a life eternal. The similarities between the Sacred Relic Sword and the Fingerslayer Blade mean that they must have shared a source, not just a corpse, but the corpse of a god. We know where the Sacred Relic Sword comes from, it comes from Radagon and Marika, but then where does the Fingerslayer Blade come from? If it's wrought from a god, it's a Nameless God, as far as we know. So it is that Loki concludes that the Nox, who made a hidden treasure of the blade, may have recovered the corpse of Placidusax's queen, the Nameless God, to wield as a weapon that could harm the greater will. So I like these theories, to say the least. They neatly tie up and reconcile a bunch of loose ends, and that makes these theories really satisfying to believe. It's nice to have an explanation for which god the Fingerslayer Blade was talking about, and which ancient god the Fingerprint Stone Shield was talking about. Special thanks to Loki for this. You can find more of his stuff in the description, and I highly recommend you seek it out. However, I should probably stress that this is still all speculation. The circumstantial evidence is really strong, yes, but sometimes FromSoftware leaves these sorts of loose ends in the lore to be tied up by characters they've yet to introduce. Until DLC drops, I think it's wise to take this theory with a grain of salt..but damn..salt makes any meal taste better, doesn't it? So it is that the nameless god of Faramazula might have become the Nox's Fingerslayer Blade, a weapon they clearly brought about in order to harm the Greater Will, which had banished them deep underground, beneath a false night sky..you can learn more about that in this video. Here they live in eternal anticipation of the coming age of stars and their liege, who would be a lord of night. These folk become obsessed with artificial imitation of life above ground, all likely created in service of their goal, which was to strike back at the Greater Will. So it was that the Mimic Tears were created. These are beings of quicksilver that were the result of an attempt by the Eternal City to forge a lord. These silver drops of dew, not unlike the Erd Tree's drops of dew, also birthed the Albinaurics, artificial lifeforms untouched by the Erd Tree's grace. But the Nox also looked further back in time for inspiration, and attempted to bring ancient dragons into being. So it is that the Dragonkin Soldiers were born in the Eternal City, where they knew no true sky, nor true lightning. Their name includes the word Soldier, and they even have evidence of clothing and armour upon them, again revealing that these creatures were created with the intention to fight back against order. However, these Dragonkin experiments went about as well as copying dragons usually does in FromSoftware games, which is to say, the experiments were a failure. The main reason they were considered failures was that these Dragonkin were not immortal, as the Nox had hoped. Their weapons read, Alas, the Dragonkin Soldiers never attained immortality, and perished as decrepit, pale imitations of their sky-born kin. But the Nox had the right idea. At the very least, it seems they had identified the source of the ancient dragon's immortality, their stone scales. They just failed to implement that source. Case in point, the Dragon Scale Blade is made by sharpening a gravel stone scale thought to be the source of dragon immortality. This blade's skill is Ice Lightning Sword, which wreathes the blade in the Dragonkin's signature ice lightning. And you know, even though the Dragonkin were born mortal and crippled, they did at least manage to manifest lightning, which is a feat that the mortal dragons, who were actually the ancient dragon's kin, never accomplished. On your way through Caled, you would have run past Grail, a mortal dragon who clearly owes their namesake to Graol, a veritable mountain found further down the way, where she lies dying, surrounded by her children on her deathbed. But these aren't her only children. According to Graol's Roar, Graol was the mother of all dragons, dwarfing all who stood before her like a looming mountain. To be clear, I seriously doubt this means she's the mother of the ancient dragons, considering she has two wings, two legs, and no stone scales. No, instead, she would specifically be the mother of the two-winged dragons you see widely across the lands between. Indeed, the Japanese specifies that she's more of a great mother of dragons, rather than being mother of all dragons. So if we take that premise to be true, that means that the fire-breathing dragons, the ice dragons, the rot and glintstone corrupted dragons, all of them trace their ancestry back to Graol. These are the wyverns, contrasting with the true four-legged dragons. Which is the same dynamic that Dark Souls had as well. And just like in Dark Souls, Elden Ring's dragons have a tendency to take on aspects of their environment, in lieu of their stone scales. There are ice dragons, glintstone dragons, all of that. But the one element that these dragons didn't master, though, is lightning. Red lightning, that remains exclusive to their ancient ancestors. Earlier we talked about how lightning has heavenly connotations, and it makes sense that this lightning would be lost to these lesser dragons, who were born in a time long after the ancient dragons had lost the favour of the greater will. These modern dragons are now easily wounded by the stone scales that they've lost. These stone scales, once removed, are called gravelstones, and these are compound stones that are found in lands once beset by ancient dragons. For the most part, these gravelstones are looted upon the Altus Plateau and surrounds. Which makes sense, because this is the territory of Leyndell, the city that the ancient dragons would eventually assault. So of course, this is where their scales would be found. But interestingly, the only other place where gravelstones are found is Caelod. And that's curious, because Caelod is literally at the opposite end of the lands between. One set of gravelstones are found here, and here, suggesting that at some point, the ancient dragons, progenitors to Gre'ol, were in Caelod as well. This fact is supported by other environmental evidence in the area. Again, the Bestial Sanctum and Farrum Great Bridge are in Caelod, two cultural landmarks of Farramazula that are architecturally intact, despite the crumbling city's current state. These weren't just ruins that fell from the sky, these were built. They are a grounded connection to what we now know as a Sky City. While I guess we can't rule out the possibility that Farramazula was always in the sky, and later built architecture on the ground here, it seems way more natural to assume that the city was originally built on the ground, where they would have been the materials to build it, and that it was then lifted into the sky at some point in the future. As for the mechanism behind Farramazula becoming skybound, I feel like there are two options. Earlier we talked about how the Ruins Greatsword is a piece of Farramazula, infused with gravitational magic thanks to the meteor that struck the city. Thus, my first theory is that Farramazula might have become skybound in the instant that the meteor struck, floating upward as it was destroyed. Alternatively, or additionally, I guess, it could be some manifestation of the storm that brought Farramazula into the sky. We've talked about how Plisigisax might have had power over this storm, evidenced by his golden time-twisting scales. Not to mention, you turn into a storm cloud when you channel Plisigisax's weapon skill. So perhaps Plisigisax, or the ancient dragons, whipped Farramazula into the skies as some measure of protection, and once it was up there, that gravitational meteor could have come into play, smashing the city into pieces on its way down to the Lands Between, scattering ruins far and wide. At any rate, I'm glad there's evidence of Farramazula here in Caelod, and that's because this fact merges so well with the lore of Graol. Again, Graol is the mother of the modern dragons, and thus is the oldest modern dragon that we know of who lost their stone scales. And since she's in Caelod, it was likely from here that all dragons spread. So I'm glad the environment supports this lore with its intact Farramazula architecture, and with the leftover gravel stones of the ancient dragons as well. Because it seems like the ancient dragons made landfall here long ago, and started a culture in Farramazula, leaving Graol behind eventually as their land-bound legacy. And there are two other ancient dragons in the vicinity to help support this claim as well. The two ancient dragons appear here in Limgrave, and here in Caelod, both dead at the sites of Dragon Communion. The ancient dragons are immortal, but they can still be killed, as you know, though we can only really speculate on what killed these two. But back to Graol. Despite being a modern dragon, Graol is large. Larger than any other dragon of the time, even Placidusax. In fact, the only thing that comes close to her in size are Gransax, and the bones of the dragon in Farramazula's Dragon Temple, which Zullie has thankfully placed alongside Graol for me. They're both very similar in size, which made me think that maybe they could have been mates at some point, though of course that's just speculation. In the end, we don't even know why Graol lost all of her stone scales, passing this trait to all of her descendants. Perhaps it was nothing more than a random birth defect. Which reminds me, Seath's loss of stone scales was never really explained either, yet he also found himself apart from his ancient kin all the same. Perhaps this is why Graol found herself in the lands between. Was this a place of exile? Maybe a place to die? The region is called Dragonbarrow, after all. If you've read Lord of the Rings, for example, you might take the meaning of the word barrow to mean burial mounds, referring to ancient burial places that are covered with large mounds of earth. Perhaps the Dragonbarrow was a place for these newly mortal dragons to die. And Graol herself is indeed now finally dying. The Scarlet Rot has blighted Caelid and the Dragonbarrow, and this is presumably why when we encounter her, she's already lost a lot of her health, and can't fight back, nor even lift herself off the ground. Her dying roars rally her kin around her, but they cannot save their mother. This level 1 Tarnished just watched this sick youtube guide on how to get 50,000 free runes at the start of the game, and nothing will stand in their way. Now we previously established Caelid and Graol as a sort of origin point for the modern dragons, so after them in the timeline, I think it's the ice dragons that would have shown up as the first major variant. According to Borealis's Mist, the ice dragons were once lords of the mountaintops. Perhaps these dragons wished to be as close as possible to the heavens, from which their ancestors descended. After all, we do see the modern dragons flying all around for Amazula, though they never make landfall. So the mountaintops might have been the next best thing as a home for the mortal dragons. Overall, the Sword of Night and Flame claims that the mountaintops nearly touched the sky. Anyway, Borealis's Mist goes on to reveal that the ice dragons were lords here at a very early point in the Lands Between's history. As shortly after, we know that they were chased from the peak by the fire giants, who also appeared at a very early point, and who claimed the mountaintops henceforth. So for the ice dragons to be here, you'd think surely they must have migrated here from Caelid. Now we previously established Caelid as an origin point for these modern dragons, so for the ice dragons to be here, surely they must have initially migrated here from Caelid. Obviously they could have just flown from Caelid to the icy mountaintops, but I remember early theories that posited that a land bridge might have once existed between Caelid and the mountaintops, and that certainly would have helped with their migration. As the theory goes, Caelid and the mountaintops are almost exclusively where you'll find the monstrous crows, the giant dogs, and most notably, the remains of the giants. These don't really appear anywhere else, and it seems way more likely to think that there was once a land bridge here, rather than thinking that they took the long way round the Lands Between on foot. What happened to this landmass is unclear, but the Lands Between itself has experienced many other geographical upheavals in the past, and losing a landmass to a meteor or whatnot might also explain the divergent evolution of the ice dragons compared to their fire-breathing kin. Also established in the mountaintops around this time were the astrologers, who preceded the sorcerers, established themselves in mountaintops that nearly touched the sky, and considered the fire giants their neighbours. This description comes to us from the Sword of Night and Flame, an heirloom of the Carian royal family, which is headed by Rinala. Rinala was a prominent astrologer, and thus has links to the mountaintops of the giants. It might be a stretch to say that she was actually there in the mountaintops all those years ago, but she did have an oath-sworn giant, and an oath-sworn dragon that can be summoned to fight for her, so I feel like it's safe to say that she's connected to the place at least. At any rate, eventually the fire giants would chase the ice dragons from the peak, and claim it for their own. Then in turn, the Zemur, an icy race of warriors, would ally with the Golden Order and oust the fire giants. This is incidental, but later in the timeline, a character called the Snowy Crone pops up. She's an old witch associated with Caria, who wielded snowy magics that, you could argue, would have been derived from the Zemur's icy mountaintops. The Zemur are, after all, the only other beings that could use cold sorceries, so perhaps she learned it from them. This Snowy Crone eventually imparted her cold sorceries to Ranni, and Ranni has clearly taken on such frost magics as a big part of her sorceress identity. A couple of dragons actually had a habit of eating glintstone sorcerers, and it was from this diet that they were corrupted. Not unlike the other dragons, who took on aspects of their environment. One of these dragons was Smarag, fought here, whose glintstone breath incantation reads Smarag was a devourer of sorcerers, and over time, his body became corrupted by their glintstones. Another such dragon is fought here, defending Ranni in both of her major quest locations. This is a dueler, and she drops a cold infused sorcery that is representative of her knighthood, and it reads, a dueler, a devourer of sorcerers, was bested by Ranni, and subsequently swore a knightly oath to her dark moon. This suggests conflict between the early sorcerers and dragons, and this tendency for there to be conflict helps to explain why Rinala might have gained an oath-sworn dragon out of these conflicts. And just like her mother before her, Ranni also had an oath-sworn dragon of her own, a dueler. A dueler reveals to us the mechanism behind this oath. Ranni bested a dueler in battle, perhaps earning a dueler's loyalty and respect. A trend that actually continues later on with some other ancient dragons that would attack Leyndell, but we'll get into that soon. The only living ice dragon we meet is Borealis the Freezing Fog, who remains upon the mountaintops. And yet, the item most closely associated with him is actually found all the way back in the temple quarter of Leonia. It is the Ice-Rind Hatchet, and its description reads, A hatchet with a frost-coated blade, one of several gifts given by Castle Sol in the distant north. Known as Freezing Fog, the blade is thought to be a dragon's scale. Indeed, this is the dragon scale of Borealis. Because just as the scale is known as Freezing Fog, Borealis also has the words Freezing Fog as his namesake. Apparently, this scale was retrieved by Borealis' neighbours at Castle Sol, who then gave it as a gift, presumably to the Leonians, since it is found near their temple quarter. Obviously, such a gift would have been given to facilitate relations between the two lands, and as we established earlier with sorcerers like the Snow Witch and Rinala, there is grounds to believe that these two places would have had a connection in the past. These days though, Castle Sol is currently still a mystery to us, and without knowing their political alignments, it's hard to know for sure why they gifted Leonia with the scale and other gifts as well. That said, there is a phantom in Castle Sol who hails Lord Michaela in his dialogue. Thus, it's possible that Michaela was Lord of Castle Sol, and that Michaela was giving gifts to Leonia. And there is evidence that Michaela had friendly relations with the Carians, at least. Most notably, in version 1.0 of Elden Ring, Loretta's armour instead belonged to cut enemies called Arbor Sentinels, who served Michaela, but who actually hailed from Raya Lucaria. To quote their cut description, these enchanted knights once belonged to the Carian royal family, but were later gifted to Michaela. Thus, perhaps Michaela, potential Lord of Castle Sol, gifted the Raya Lucarians the Ice-Rind Hatchet, and several other gifts besides, in return for all the knights he had gained from them. Again, this is all just speculation, but this is the best theory I've got on the relationship between these two lands, and why the Ice-Rind Hatchet is found in Leonia. On the same plateau as Castle Sol is the Cave of the Forlorn, a unique little cave guarded by Great Worm Theodorix. Theodorix is a magma worm, a land-bound dragon that looks more like a giant lizard than a dragon. He's in this form thanks to the act of Dragon Communion, a primal ritual that involves consuming a dragon's heart to become a dragon. Didn't work out so well for him, but his scalesword at least resembles a dragon's jaw, and the weapon suggests that Dragon Communion is a grave transgression, for which the magma worms were cursed to crawl the earth upon their bellies, shadows of their former selves. If they were cursed to be this way, by any entity, I'd suggest it was the Greater Will, who we know favoured the ancient dragons long ago. To be clear, only the English description says they were cursed. The Japanese description is nowhere near as damning, simply saying that the heroes have erred, and that their land-crawling form is the end result. To me, it sounds more like these people were simply fools to think that they could achieve such a metamorphosis. It goes against the rules of nature, especially if you're trying to transform into a being like an ancient dragon, who were graced by the Greater Will in a bygone age. And I think, more than it being a curse, I think this is more of an example of hubris backfiring for each and every one of these partakers of Dragon Communion. The Magma Worm's scalesword states that these land-bound dragons were once human heroes. But that's only half true for Theodorics, who was a hero, but who wasn't human. He was actually a troll. His incantation, Theodorics' Magma, states that the name of the ancient troll warrior, Theodorics, lives on, as a hero of the war against the giants. Actually, maybe his troll heritage explains why his Magma Worm form is so much tougher than the others. It has so much HP that, fun fact, you can actually lure a land octopus to help you with this fight instead. And I think that's the intended way, because this guy is tough. What's also fascinating about this guy is that he was specifically a hero of the war against the giants, a battle that many of his fellow trolls participated in, betraying their giant ancestors and fighting alongside the Golden Order. Now, I assume Theodorics was still a troll at this stage, and not a Magma Worm, but whatever the case, you could definitely speculate that he is still loyal to the Golden Order even now, even here after his metamorphosis. I argue this because of his placement outside the cave of the Forlorn, which has an end boss wielding a legendary armament, the Golden Order Greatsword, one of Radagon's own weapons. The Leonine Misbegotten themselves are curious as well, with internal files calling them Children of Radagon, but that's a whole other topic. Unique to this cave also is that right inside, there's a fire-breathing dragon, dead and half entombed within the ice. For this type of dragon to be preserved in this place might support what I speculated on earlier, which is that Grail's fire-breathing children must have come up here to settle on the peaks before becoming ice dragons. It might also support the theory that Rinala acquired an oathsworn fire-breathing dragon just like this one early in the days when they settled here alongside the astrologers. Or maybe it's just here because a dragon hunter is right outside. And I say dragon hunter because even though the dragon-hearted, like Theodoric's, aspired to become dragons by consuming their hearts, that doesn't mean that they respected their lives. A phantom can even be found saying, I'm dry, dry as a bone. Fool dragon, surrender your strength, let me feast on your heart. As for the hearts of these dragons themselves, they are riddled with gravelstone. You'll recall, gravelstones were the scales of the ancient dragons, making it somewhat ironic that the mortal dragons actually do have these same scales just within their hearts, not on their flesh. As such, their hearts, which are clearly imbued with some ancient dragon immortality, are still alive and beating, according to the description. And so, when you consume these hearts in what is absolutely a sacrificial ritual, especially considering the heart is still alive, you're actually consuming gravelstone, ingesting the key components of the ancient dragons via the hearts of their mortal kin. Pretty metal. Indeed, when you partake in dragon communion with the heart at the dragon communion altars, you're doing so right in front of a dead ancient dragon, not in front of a mortal one. Thus, you really are striving to be like the ancients. Churches were built upon the corpses of these undying beings, who became likely unwilling conduits for countless dragon-hearted heroes who wished to channel the power of dragons. Finally, the dragon communion seal. It's formless, because it's made of dragon blood, and even though it's a seal, dragon communion is too primal in nature for the term incantation to be appropriate. Thus, this seal scales incantations with one's arcane attribute. So yeah, it's no wonder that all of the dragon-hearted are considered to be so depraved. This is Eura, who you first meet in Limgrave, and nearby, beside the dragon-burnt ruins is the mortal dragon, Agheel. Agheel frequents this place, coming to burn the mindless nobles and their effigies here, which is exactly what the nobles want. After death, most in the lands between crave a proper Erd Tree burial. But now, in lieu of that perhaps, the dead gazed at the skies over the lakes of Limgrave, praying that the dragon's flames would burn them to ash. They want this kind of release from life. If you get Eura to assist you in taking out Agheel, then it's possible to get him to say this. I was my first dragon hunt in quite some time. Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times. So Eura was previously a dragon hunter, which helps to explain his familiarity with communion. And since being paired up with a hothead like you was just like old times, that means he must have once had a companion. The most likely candidate for this is Eleonora, a drake knight that Eura tracks all the way to the Altus Plateau, only to plead with them on a very personal level. The precious little we know about Eleonora stems mostly from her drake knight armour, which is crafted from dragon wing membranes, and features the spoils of a dragon catch as an emblem of pride as both dragon hunter and partaker of communion. From birth, drake knights speak not a word. They spend their lives pursuing the strength of dragons, for its sublime beauty and inspiration of awe. Therefore, while the drake knights have more reverence of dragons, they are still partakers of communion. Thus, as they consume more hearts, their eyes become yellow and slitted, and inevitably, they have a fate waiting for them as a magma worm. So given all you've heard about communion, is it really any surprise that there would be a dragon named the Dragon Communion Revenger? This is Exikis, who guards the decrepit Temple of Communion in Caled, attempting to prevent this abhorrent act of dragon communion via sheer will and hatred. For, Exikis had the misfortune of taking on the Scarlet Rot as his aspect, something that has clearly taken a toll on him. But according to his incantation, Exikis, Dragon Communion Revenger, did not forget his hatred, even as he succumbed to the Scarlet Rot. So Exikis, at least, has a very good reason for attacking you, as he's preventing access to the nearby altar of dragon communion. But speaking of dragons who attack humans, let's turn our attention to the ancient dragons, who would one day attack the city of Leyndell. These ancient dragons attacked with all their might, bringing with them Gransax, an ancient dragon who is the largest dragon in the game, who reigned calamity down upon the royal capital with such force that this marks the only time in historical record that Leyndell's walls had fallen. Thus began Leyndell's war against the ancient dragons. It's hard to know for sure why the ancient dragons attacked Leyndell. If you want to go full tinfoil hat and tie it to our earlier speculations, then you might say that it's because they finally realised their god had fled here and become the Urd Tree or something, but that might be stretching it. That said, they probably did come here because of the Urd Tree. After all, according to the Protection of the Urd Tree incantations, in the beginning, everything was in opposition to the Urd Tree, and the ancient dragons were probably no exception. So it was that the ancient dragons fell upon Leyndell, their forces consisting of at least three dragons we know of, Lanceax and her red lightning glaive, Fortisax and his twin pillars of red lightning, and Gransax, a gargantuan dragon wielding a physical weapon, a decision that seems unique to them. This is the Bolt of Gransax, a weapon that's actually mirrored in Placigiousax's fight against us here. It's unclear whether Placigiousax is echoing Gransax or if Gransax is echoing Placigiousax, but the fact that Gransax shares a weapon with Placigiousax, and the fact that Gransax is so large, certainly makes me think that Gransax is the closest thing the ancient dragons might have had to a lord, at the time of their attack upon Leyndell, at any rate. But this weapon would eventually fall from their grasp, as the Great Gransax was slain, their stone body and weapon becoming this permanent landmark within Leyndell's walls. According to Lightning Spear's description, Godwin the Golden defeated the ancient dragon Fortisax, known as the Mightiest Boulderstone. Assumedly, Godwin could have executed Fortisax here, or perhaps compelled Fortisax to swear an oath to him, just like Rennala and Ranni once did, but instead, he befriended his fallen foe, and as a result, Fortisax would be loyal, so loyal that Fortisax would eventually go beyond to fight against the death that would take his companion, becoming a Lich Dragon, his aspect afflicted with death itself. So to recap, when Godwin was murdered on the Night of Black Knives, the Rune of Death was carved into his being, destroying his soul, but not his body. And so it was that his body spawned Deathroot, fragments of the Rune of Death that spreads its influence throughout the Lands Between, spawning the visage of the Prince of Death, who was Godwin, in its wake. And while Godwin does seem like a lost cause, Fortisax fought against the death within him nonetheless. So it is that Fortisax occupies a deathbed dream within his friend, fighting this impossible fight against the corrupting influence of the Rune of Death, which has now corrupted Fortisax. But I still don't think that Fortisax has been completely corrupted. When you fight against Fortisax here, you actually do so to bring about the age of those who live in death. And considering Fortisax fights against you, you could speculate that Fortisax is still vehemently opposed to death and those who live within death, even now. Check out this video for more on that. It should come as no surprise that this friendship between Godwin and Fortisax was seen as significant in Leyndell, when Fortisax was first defeated. This moment of friendship was so significant that it would make allies of all the ancient dragons, and give rise to the ancient dragon cult in the capital city. It seems the ancient dragon cult was born born out of a desire to defend the Erd Tree. As stated by the Malformed Dragon set, after the great ancient dragon Gransax attacked, the tree sentinels had an epiphany. The only way to truly protect the Erd Tree was to become dragons themselves. So it was that these regular tree sentinels became draconic tree sentinels. As a fun side note, the 1.0 description of the Malformed Dragon set instead talks about a dragon worshipper named Gnarl, who I speculate is this individual defending Malekith in Faramzulla. His set once read, Once a dragon worshipper from the capital, it's said that he pulverised his golden armour with his bare hands in a fit of religious fervour, covering it in his own blood as he reshaped it in the likeness of a dragon. But anyway, in the final version of the game, there's more than one draconic tree sentinel, and they wield armaments whittled from dragon claws so that they could better honour the ancient dragons in their worship without resorting to the primal act of dragon communion. Conveniently, for them, it was found that dragon worship didn't clash with belief in the Erd Tree. The Gravelstone Seal says as much, stating, After all, this seal and lightning itself are both imbued with gold. And this goes beyond just colour. The ancient dragons were originally a part of the Greater Will's plan back in Faramzulla, and their golden scales reflect that. And after the Dragon War, these ancients became a part of the Greater Will's plan once more, albeit in a more subservient role than in their previous age. One thing that's kind of difficult to reconcile with the Dragon Cult is the fact that their prayer books, cookbooks, spells, and even a draconic tree sentinel can be found in Faramzulla. Special thanks to VLimit on YouTube for making me aware of this. The ancient Dragon War in Leyndell would have surely happened after Faramzulla's age had passed, so how did all of this get up there? Either Faramzulla became skybound much later in the timeline than I thought, or perhaps dragon cultists simply travelled up to Faramzulla with these relics somehow. And I think this second theory is much more likely, because in an earlier version of the game, Faramzulla was called the Storm Eyrie, and was, and I quote, a place that only dragons can reach. This reminds me a lot of Archdragon Peak in Dark Souls 3, which could only be accessed through a sort of draconic meditation. So perhaps Faramzulla was once planned to be accessed in a similar way. For all we know, it could still be canon that those in tune with dragons are spirited up here. For instance, some banished knights certainly found a way up here, and they have dragons cresting their helmet. And this helmet once described how they sought the Storm Eyrie, presumably through revering dragons. Therefore, I feel like remnants of characters being spirited up here due to their association with dragons is a bit of a holdover from a past version of the game that still exists in the current version. And while we don't get spirited up in the current game by becoming a dragon, we are certainly spirited up here. This teleportation occurs when you sacrifice Melina, or yourself in the frenzy ending. Now the mechanism behind this is kind of unclear, but there is sort of a prophecy that helps to explain it. Melina's blade of calling reads, the one who walks alongside flame shall one day meet the road of destined death. So whether you walk alongside Melina, the kindling maiden, or the god of frenzied flame, or your Alexander tempering yourself in the flames of Gelmir and the Giants forge, you're going to make it up here one way or another and meet the road of destined death. Speaking of which, this also explains why Benal is up here. According to his beast champion armor, his maiden threw herself into the fire, just like Melina does for us, which is what gets us up here. And he too, also has a fate that ends with destined death, just like we do. So there's definitely some sort of fate associated with destined death that is spiriting us up here, I think that's for sure. And to explain most others up here in Faramazula, well again, I personally think that they were likely spirited up thanks to their draconic nature, as explained by the cut content from that earlier version of Elden Ring. For all the humans who desired to commune with dragons, there was one dragon who actually communed with humans, Lanceax. Lanceax was the sister of Fortisax, and while you fight her as a dragon in-game, long ago she took the form of a human, to better commune with the Dragon Knights, as a priestess of the ancient dragon cult of Leyndell. The fact that she was able to take human form is pretty amazing. This is almost a reflection of dragon communion, but instead of changing form and communing with dragons, she's changing form to better commune with humans. A part of this communion, apparently, was love. And according to Dragonbolt Blessing, only those loved by dragons can survive the ordeal of cladding their bodies in lightning. And of all the knights, Vyke the Dragonspear was the one Lanceax loved the most. Fittingly, Vyke's Dragonbolt is unique in that it clads him and his spear in red lightning, the signature weapon of the ancient dragons, reserved up until this point for the beastmen who served them in antiquity. This also marks Vyke as a dragon cultist. Therefore, it's kind of crazy to think that a dragon cultist almost became Elden Lord, something that surely would have had implications for the age that would follow if Vyke was to take the throne. This must have made it all the more painful for many when Vyke suddenly disappeared, travelling below Leyndell to visit the Three Fingers, where he was burned by their frenzy, armour, and all. Knowing that he was a dragon cultist certainly helps to explain how he got down here. The fact that he was surely this highly regarded member of Leyndell's dragon cult, you'd think would open doors for him within the city. So, Vyke likely could have made the trip down here easily, despite the existence of the Three Fingers being sacrilegious to the Order up above. We get little information on why Vyke made this trip, but in the end, we eventually find him imprisoned within an Evergale. And whether this imprisonment is self-imposed or not also remains a bit of a mystery. But anyway, back to Lanceax, who loved Vyke. The most interesting thing here with her, I think, isn't just the fact that we've learned that dragons can turn into humans, it's the fact that dragons can love. Perhaps this love and powerful emotion is part of what makes them so loyal. We see many becoming oathsworn, and then Vordisax, for example, going so far as to sacrifice himself entirely for his friend. And it's this fact that makes the Elden Lord Placidusax's abandonment by his god all the more tragic. For their god would never return, and eventually a Tarnished would find their way beyond time, putting an end to the Dragonlord, and hewing their remembrance into the Erd Tree. In the end, all that remains is Placidusax's ruin, the dying whales of the Dragonlord, who once dwelled eternally beyond time. Thank you for watching. But before I go, do you want some Elden Ring wall art to adorn your walls? Well, Displate has you covered in this video, because they're back helping to support more Elden Ring lore content. For a limited time only, they are giving you these deals on screen to pick up some Displates in the next few weeks. Link in the description. So the choice is yours, you can literally get official Elden Ring art to adorn your walls. For example, this shot of Godfrey and Vyke look absolutely stunning. But then you can also get some Elden Ring inspired pieces from my store, if you like. For example, this is Guardian of Moonlight, which features a dragon defending a moonlight sword from nightly intruders. Or you could pick up Early Days, which gives off some Elden Ring vibes from back before the game was even released, if you were around then. Or if you're a fan of From Software games in general, you could go and pick up The Painted World, with Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring all condensed into one world. It'll take you hours of scrutiny to discover all of the references that we've hidden in here. As I've said so many times before, these prints are made of metal, they're easy to hang, and somehow they achieve this gorgeous colour depth and accuracy that exceeds most of the traditional prints that I've sampled. Again, links in the description, and thank you for watching. It feels good to be back doing Elden Ring lore, and my goal now is to wrap up everything I can before the Elden Ring DLC drops, so there should be some good times ahead, you know, bringing in the new year as well. Before I go, earlier I shouted out Loki's theory on the Nameless God, as I call them, and I'd again like to remind you to go and support Loki, and check out their other lore content for yourself as well. And if you have any other suggestions for other content creators whose theories you'd like to see cited in future lore videos, please let me know, and I'll do my best to do that. Special thanks also to Mispap for doing an incredible edit of this video. The footage looks amazing, and it's incredible that he can get this much quality footage, even for a video that is an hour and a half long, so I hope that fact really helps you guys watch the content and engage with it. Thank you again for watching, and I'll see you in the next lore video.\n",

      "[Doc 12: The Lore of Elden Ring is Cursed]\n",
      "Up until last week, we didn't know much about the DLC. In fact, we knew But now we know that the DLC entrance is here in Moguen Palace before Michaela's withered arm I think it could be important to understand the circumstances of Michaela's death here at the hands of Mogue So let's dive in As the age of the Erd Tree began, Mogue was born, of the union between Queen Marika and Lord Godfrey Godfrey was the first Elden Lord, and as such, Mogue is one of the oldest demigods alongside his siblings who were Morgoth and Godwin Mogue and Morgoth were twins, born together and born as omen Placing them in stark contrast to their brother Godwin, who was the golden child, so to speak Omen like Mogue and Morgoth on the other hand were considered to be cursed But what are the omen? Skip this chapter if you've heard it all before, but I think the omen are born by chance Sprouting these grotesque horns that are vestiges of the primordial crucible So what is the crucible? The crucible is a melting pot of life that Existed before the Erd Tree, and its energies are actually what became the Erd Tree It's here that there was this blending of many creatures physiological aspects like feathers, tail, knot scale, fang, and horn What's truly noteworthy about these aspects is that they would sometimes come to grow on creatures that weren't supposed to have them. For example, kill a deer or sheep or even an ancestral follower in the lands between, and there's a tiny chance that you'll receive a budding horn Which I think are not unlike the horns of the omen The budding horn reads, this horn began to sprout on a beast that typically bears no horn Perhaps it is a vestige of the primordial crucible According to the crucible talismans, there was a time when these aspects, like horns, were once considered Signifiers of the divine, and that makes some sense because these aspects stem from the crucible Which did become the Erd Tree, so why wouldn't they be considered holy? And so it's during this time that we have to assume that the ancient warriors known as the crucible knights were knighted, serving Lord Godfrey and fighting with many aspects of the crucible including horn, tail, breath, and even wing But fast forward to the current age and the crucible knights are lost, scattered all over the lands between Fighting for different causes or for no cause at all And that's because Queen Marika's Golden Order abandoned them The crucible gauntlets reveal that in time the strength shown by these knights and even their appearance Came to be looked upon with scorn for having such close resemblance to chaos This matches a wider trend in Marika's Golden Order where things were moving away from chaos and the crucible And even the Erd Tree and towards fundamentalism instead as the age of the Erd Tree progressed But the crucible knights got off easy, all things considered. Take these creatures for example Previously they were seen as divine for having aspects of the crucible at birth But eventually they came to be called misbegotten instead, a word that really sends the vibe that these were now seen as contemptible creatures bearing ill-gotten gains The misbegotten became seen as Impure, a fact revealed by the spirit ashes of Perfumer Trishia Who was a healer who dedicated her efforts to treating misbegotten and the omen as well The omen and the misbegotten certainly needed treatment as many of them suffered these grievous wounds as a result of their horns being cut off Those responsible for these wounds in particular were the omen killers, a sect of Leyndell butchers who had full authority to hunt the omen and amputate their horns So in my opinion, the tradition of cutting off omen horns would have begun because horns are the offending part of the omen as they represent their link to the primordial crucible which is something that became this accursed concept And omen do bear more aspects of the crucible than just horns. Moog has a set of wings Just like the misbegotten and Morgoth might as well, though They're only really rigged in his animation files. Instead, Morgoth has a tail just like the crucible knights All that said, the defining aspect of the omen are definitely the horns That and their brute strength were enough to label them as omen, distinct from the misbegotten but still born by chance Though many omen were apparently born directly from the Erd tree's royal line Two of the darkest items in the game are the omen bairn and the regal omen bairn The word bairn means child and these items are dolls. They're fetishes that were fashioned to memorialize omen children who are dead or who might as well be The omen bairn's description reads Omen babies have all their horns excised Causing most to perish and those that survive live alongside those memorialized by the regal omen bairn Which reads omen babies born of royalty do not have their horns excised, but instead are kept underground unbeknownst to anyone Imprisoned for eternity So some concessions were made for omen as opposed to the misbegotten Two omen children, Moog and Morgoth, were after all a part of the golden lineage so the royal omens weren't mutilated as long as their horns were out of mind and out of sight And speaking of sight, a horn seems to be responsible for Moog Literally being half blind as it has grown relentlessly into his eye socket Incidentally, there's a bit of a trend with blind characters in Elden Ring and in other FromSoftware games as well And it's that those blinded are Ironically able to see what sighted folk cannot. For example in Elden Ring It was the exiled prophets who accurately foresaw the flame of ruin burning down the earth tree And it was the guilty, their eyes gouged by thorns, who glimpsed an outer god in the darkness There are lots of examples So I guess coincidentally or not, Moog, half blind and wounded Eventually did come to stand before an outer god of his own as well and he met her deep underground This outer god was called the formless mother and the mother of truth A fitting choice for the omen whose true mother had abandoned him We've talked about outer gods in other videos But long story short, they're these cosmic Lovecraftian entities that are at once extremely powerful But also strangely limited in how they can influence events in the lands between Instead of getting involved directly, they will often commune through envoys or vessels and in the case of the formless mother Her subject of communion, one of them at least, was Moog. The blood boon Incantation describes Moog's meeting with this outer god It reads, the mother of truth craves wounds. When Moog stood before her deep underground His accursed blood erupted with fire and he was besotted with the defilement that he was born into The text also describes what happens when you cast this incantation You thrust your arm into the body of the formless mother, then scatter the blood flame to set the area ablaze So there's a lot to break down with this one description But let's start with the fact that this outer god is at once both the formless mother and the mother of truth So what exactly do these titles mean? Let's start with the formless mother because I feel like that title is easier to rationalize she is likely formless because liquid blood is her essence and Incidentally, the word formless is also used to describe the dragon communion seal in Elden Ring Which is also made of blood But let's cast our net beyond Elden Ring to Bloodborne where an extremely relevant parallel to the formless mother Exists in the character of formless Erden, which is also an outer god of sorts The Erden Carol rune states that blood is the essence of the formless great one Erden and While I absolutely think that the universes of Bloodborne and Elden Ring are separate I'm confident that FromSoftware are reusing a concept from Bloodborne here in Elden Ring So it is that I'm confident that blood is also the essence of the formless mother That said the formless mother still has a body of sorts we thrust our arm cross-dimensionally into it when we cast Bloodborne and When we rip our arm out we scatter not just blood but blood flame Thus while I think the formless mother absolutely has an affinity for any blood I think her essence is more accurately blood flame and She's not the only outer god with a flame of her own the fel god has Giants flame Death has black flame and ghost flame Frenzy has frenzy flame and you could even theorize that the greater will has the golden fire that spews from the mouth of the Elden Beast and Placidus axe So flame is commonly a sign of an outer gods essence And I think the formless mother is no different with a blood flame that continues to threaten rupture on Those afflicted long after it touches their flesh The formless mother's other title is the mother of truth and this title is a lot harder to interpret The mother of truth what truth? The only character that we know of that the mother of truth has appeared before is Moog So we're kind of forced to judge her character through his and While I guess it's possible that the mother of truth venerates the absolute truth or a broader truth The fact that she chooses to act through Moog is at least a little bit telling We know that she bestows power upon accursed blood and I think this preference for accursed blood Might be a part of the truth that she represents I think she might prefer to act through those who are unfairly cursed like the omen Like Moog and I say unfairly cursed because that's kind of what curses are always in from software games Curses are always the domain of the gods and they're always delivered pretty heavy-handedly Take Dark Souls for example where Gwyn a god Refused to relinquish his age of fire opting instead to curse humanity with undeath So that they might fuel his fire until the world turns to ash pretty over-the-top right and Queen Marika is actually very similar to Gwyn in that she's a god who Arrogantly thinks her order is perfect to the point where she'll do anything to try and preserve it Her hubris is alluded to in the mending rune of perfect order description which states that the current imperfection of the Golden Order or instability of ideology can be blamed upon the fickleness of the gods no better than men and it's the same Hubris that led to the scorn of the crucible and I think the curse upon the omen as well To make things even more unfair for the omen Their curse appears to largely be one of perception of hate The omen Bairn description conflates these two things and speaks from the perspective of an omen child who pleads Please don't hate me or curse me, please I also think this notion of curses being unfair is Explored further in the dung eaters questline where the dung eater goes around Defiling others and spreading the omen curse. He calls this defilement his cursed blessing Because if he defiles everyone in the end Everyone will be cursed and therefore no one will be Thus in his ending a sort of cursed justice is restored to the world Elden Ring has this consistent theme where characters turn their curse into their strength And I think the dung eater and Moog are perfect examples of that and this is just my theory But I think the mother of truth might bestow power upon the accursed because the truth is that Curses of the gods are unfairly given. There should be nothing wrong with being born with omen horns, right? it's just this genetic trait a Vestige of the primordial crucible that was once even considered divine But thanks to the Golden Order, these creatures are now considered omens instead So I'd like to argue that this unfairness is why the mother of truth bestows power upon accursed blood But of course, this is just my theory and I welcome any challenges to it in the comments I think challenging each other respectfully is how we can get a bit closer to the truth Speaking of I saw arguments ages ago that stated that the formless mother is Responsible for the curse of the omen, but I'd like to challenge that idea. I'm not sure it can be correct for one It's stated that Moog first stood before the formless mother Underground and he was only down here because he was already banished here for being omen So he must have been omen before this meeting. What's more when he did stand before her It's stated that his accursed blood erupted with fire Thus his blood was already accursed when it erupted with fire Finally, it says Moog was besotted with the defilement that he was born into Thus he was born omen like all of the other omen children born to be shunned in a wretched mire Underground, but I think there's a reason that people argue that the formless mother created the omen And I think one of the arguments is that Morgoth, Moog's brother also has blood flame attacks Just like his brother So I think people reason that blood flame is therefore synonymous with Having accursed blood and that all omen have it But that's not true because only Moog and Morgoth seem to have blood that was set ablaze It's clear Moog's was set ablaze in item descriptions And it's clear Morgoth weaponized his own flaming blood by recanting it But no other omen fight with blood flame So I reckon they both received this blood flame from the formless mother I think the formless mother appeared before not just Moog, but Morgoth as well Even though that's never mentioned. Only difference was Moog embraced this power and Morgoth spurned it Indeed Morgoth only uses blood flame against us in his boss fight as a last resort Morgoth's blood flame became a cursed sword that reads Weapon of shifting hue used by Morgoth, the omen king. The accursed blood that Morgoth recanted and sealed away reformed into this blade For him to have this I think proves that it wasn't just Moog that was approached by the formless mother It was Morgoth as well. They were both underground Assumedly sealed in the same place after all, so I think both of them had their accursed blood set aflame I think the mother of truth like so many other outer gods Attempted to influence a demigod and I think they failed with Morgoth, but succeeded with Moog In the end both Moog and Morgoth weaponized their trauma. For Moog, we can look at the cursed blood pot for example, which you throw at enemies to douse them in accursed blood, causing summoned spirits to assail them with a rabid fervor, a childhood memory of the Lord of Blood. It's basically saying that Moog remembers being attacked for his accursed blood as a child, and considering the blood specifically motivates spirits to attack, it might be referencing Moog's experience of being haunted by evil spirits. According to the omen smirk mask, evil spirits haunt the omen in their nightmares. So with this cursed blood pot, now Moog could give others a similar experience. The Mother of Truth craves wounds. She desires bloodshed, swarm of flies, blood boon, blood flame. Everything to do with her is designed to let the blood flow. So the Mother of Truth's base desires are quite simple, but does she want more? Where do her goals end, and where do Moog's begin? Well, beyond specifically wanting to empower the accursed, and beyond craving bloodshed, the Mother of Truth doesn't seem to want much. Take Moog's sacred spear, for example. It's called an instrument of communion with an outer God, and all it seems to do is pierce the Formless Mother, coating the blade in her blood flame. That's it. That's the communion. What's more, this sacred spear is a design that will come to symbolize his dynasty. Not the Formless Mother's dynasty, Moog's dynasty. The Formless Mother might enable this, but at the end of the day, she is behind Moog's dynasty, but she's not the face of it. So the most you could say, I think, is that she has ambition, yes, but she's not interested in being this God that's worshipped. I think that's very fitting for an outer God, actually. Instead, it's Moog's ambition that we should talk about, and it's Moog's ambition that led him to leave the sewers long ago. Probably as soon as he could overpower the shackles that bound him here. This battle you have down here with Moog is actually with an Omen illusion. Not unlike the fight that you have with Morgoth's illusion. Omen have this ability to conjure illusions. We can sort of infer that from the soundtrack, which calls them Omen illusions. Morgoth uses his illusion to hinder the tarnished. His is pretty easy to understand, but it's kind of hard to understand why Moog's illusion is down here in the sewers. Moog's true location is a bit of a mystery, so maybe he put the illusion here to throw trackers off the scent and sort of pretend that he was still in the sewers, or did he leave it here to prevent access to the frenzied flame? Because his brother Morgoth does something similar down here after all. This illusion of Moog might even be conjured up by Morgoth, because I just noticed that it seems to erupt into golden particles when it's defeated. Still, it's impossible to know for sure. Anyway, nearby you can find an Omen shackle. These shackles have lost most of their power now. Indeed, Moog has long escaped the sewers, and not even the all-knowing knows where to find him. But he's here, somewhere underneath the land of Celed, a so-called Lord of Blood who rules in the ruins of an ancient civilization, which he has decided will be the seat of his coming dynasty. This place is drenched in blood, swarming with Moog's servants, and the Crumbling Palace itself is awash with the formless Mother's blood flame. But it was not always this way. The map of Moogwyn Palace reads, and the Crumbling Palace itself is awash with the formless Mother's blood flame. But it was not always this way. The map of Moogwyn Palace reads, So, this ancient civilization existed long before Moog. What was this place? This ancient dynasty isn't given a name, but everything here should look very familiar. The underground woodland evokes the one found in Shifra. The statues depict the same bearded figure as the statues in Uld and Ul. These are the remains of an ancient dynasty that can be found all over the lands between, and Moog has very intentionally started to build his dynasty on the remains of their own. Moog calling his rule a dynasty is intentionally evocative of the ancient dynasty. We know about this ancient dynasty because of the oracle bubbles, which are the sorceries of the claymen who served as priests in the ancient dynasty. The description goes on to state, And there's a whole video to be had on this topic, so I won't go too deep into this for now, especially since their culture doesn't really seem relevant to Moog at all. Because I don't think Moog is intent on reviving the old dynasty or continuing it. Rather, item descriptions stress that his is a new dynasty, and if there's anything from the old dynasty that he does use, like the architectural remains of the palace, or even possibly the antiquated Latin that he speaks, I feel he might be trying to evoke the old dynasty because he might have envied how widespread the old dynasty was, and I think he wants his dynasty to have this air of legitimacy, something it sorely lacks at the moment. Moog's new dynasty is very different from the old. The Swarm of Flies incantation sums it up well, and reads, These flies can be cast as a blood oath incantation, which are spells directly linked to Moog's own power. But aside from the incantation, these flies also spawn from the blood-tainted excrement that you can loot in this area, which contain dense colonies of tiny eggs of unknown, but assuredly revolting origin. The roped fly pot elaborates, stating, while the grating sound of their wings assails their sanity. And specifically, these flies spawn from the excrement of carnivorous beasts, of which there are now many in the new dynasty, all festering with these bloody pustules, and being even tougher than their kin on the surface. So yeah, not a great place. And yet, many disenfranchised beings still seem to choose to reside here, soaking in the festering blood swamp. Which brings us to the Albinaurics here. In a way, the Albinaurics themselves have accursed blood, not unlike the Omen. The Albinaurics blood clot reads, Albinaurics are life forms made by human hands. Thus, many believe them to live impure lives, untouched by the Ode Tree's grace. Now, this is just my own speculation, but we know that the Formless Mother bestows power upon accursed blood. So do you think maybe it's fitting that, of all the creatures in this blood-soaked land, many of the Albinaurics have found a way to weaponize the blood? I think they've accepted Moog's tainted blood quite well. The red Albinaurics stand apart from their silver kin, who sit dejectedly upon the cliff face. The red ones patrol the area, and fight with attacks that are actually unique from every other Albinaurics in the game. Even their model is a little bit unique, beyond just being red. Look at their heads, and you'll see these tiny little Omen horns sprouting. Personally, I believe this is because they've been soaking in blood. Specifically, I think they've been tainted by Moog's Omen blood. We know from the Seedbed Curse icon, and the Dungeater questline, that it's possible to spread Omen horns. Or, at least, that horns are an aspect of a defilement that can be spread. So, I think that explains why they're sprouting horns here. And there is also evidence that reveals Moog was attempting to share his accursed blood with others. This leads us to Vare, and the War Surgeons, who were abducted by Moog, who wanted to see if they could tame the accursed blood. As you enter the Moogwin Palace grounds, three white-robed invaders assail you, one after the other. These are the Nameless White Masks, and they kind of have fascinating lore to speak of. The White Masks wear the War Surgeon gown, which marks them as War Surgeons, who were effectively Mercy Killers. The Dagger Talisman elaborates, stating that the white-garbed Field Surgeons come to the aid of friend and foe alike, by dealing a final deadly thrust to spare them from the prolonged agony of a mortal wound. So, their name is a bit misleading, as there isn't really any surgery occurring here that could save someone's life. Their favoured weapon is the Meserikord, a dagger with a name that translates to mercy. And it reads, Dagger favoured by military physicians in white. Medicine is mercy, and mercy upon the battlefield is ruthless. The White Masks' weapon is found in a storage quarter of Stormvale, and their talisman is found in Volcano Manor, so it's kind of difficult to say which faction they served, if any. After all, they delivered death equally to friend and foe, so they were probably a common sight on the battlefields of the Shattering, regardless of their allegiance. Their choice of white clothing is curious as well. In war, white is the colour of truce, which is appropriate for these somewhat neutral characters, and incidentally, I think white also shows bloodstains a lot more starkly, and maybe that's why the colour was chosen as well. These characters definitely got their hands dirty as they delivered their mercy, but constantly delivering mercy would eventually cause them to turn depraved. The dagger talisman ends with the line, a sense of mercy is a catalyst for bloodlust, and their weapon warns one to beware the killers, clothed as men of compassion. So the war surgeons inevitably developed this taste for blood, and it was this very fact that eventually led to them being targeted and abducted by Moog. The war surgeon gown reads, Of the surgeons that were abducted by the Lord of Blood, none were able to tame the accursed blood, none but Vare, that is, though he was an exception. Therefore, the war surgeons, these nameless white masks that assail you in Moogwin Palace, ended up here because they were unexpectedly abducted by the Lord of Blood. This reveals that Moog was searching for potentates who might be able to control the accursed blood that he had been graced with. It's more proof that he was looking to share his accursed blood with others, and considering these surgeons now invade on behalf of Moog, it seems clear that they were happy on some level to have this new violent outlet for their bloodlust. Though, only one of their number actually manages to tame the accursed blood as Moog desired, and that's Vare. But what does that really mean, to tame the accursed blood? Well, earlier we speculated that the albinorics are growing horns because they've been doused not just in blood, but in Moog's accursed omen blood, and I really do think that there's a lot of evidence that Moog is trying to find worthy recipients who can tame his essence, because instead of the phrase tame the accursed blood, the original Japanese actually says something a bit closer to accept the accursed blood, which brings me to this interaction with Vare, where he gives you a wound and you accept what is assumedly Moog's noble blood. Give me your finger. This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor once it settles inside of you. Oh, good heavens, clench your teeth or something. The bloody finger item, which is your finger, I might add, reads Glistening blood has been siphoned into the nail of this finger. Its sickly pale skin feels nothing now, but the nail still aches with the sweetest pain. Never forget that feeling of agony. For it is what binds you to Luminary Moog, to all of us. And with a fresh infusion of this accursed noble blood, you can invade other tarnished and sate your bloodlust, materializing out of blood in other worlds, just like Moog does. But that's not the only way that you can invade with what is assumedly Moog's blood. You can also do so with a festering bloody finger. These are consumable items and they're not your finger this time, and three of them are given to you by Vare, and he gives them to you as a test of sorts. Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise. A means for circumventing the draw of the two fingers. Give it a try, won't you? Vare is hoping that you'll use these to fuel a bloodlust of your own, thereby distracting you from the allure of the two fingers who have other plans for you as a tarnished. And if you prove this bloodlust to Vare, you'll be inducted into their order and you'll have blood infused into you, perhaps as he and other war surgeons once received. Mmm, I knew it from the very start. You have a taste for noble blood. As opposed to the bloody finger you can receive, these consumable festering bloody fingers are blackened with blood congestion, and if you look closely, what looked like omen horns appear to be writhing at the end, reinforcing the idea again that it's Moog's accursed blood that had been injected into these fingers before they were cut off. The description goes on to state that these festering fingers have been chopped off rather unceremoniously. The lack of ceremony indicates a measure of disappointment with the owner of these fingers, I think, and that's why I think these fingers once belonged to other inductees, just like the nameless war surgeons who failed to accept the infusion of Moog's blood. Note this dialogue from Vare, if you deny him. You will die nameless, without ceremony. So the nameless war surgeons are likely also those whose fingers were unceremoniously chopped off, it seems. They're a warning of what could happen to you if you listen to Vare's speech, which is enticing in its splendor, but full of deadly consequence. Despite this harsh treatment of his subjects, Moog is different to the Two Fingers, according to Vare, at least, and one of the key differences, apparently, is love. In his dialogue, Vare laments that the Two Fingers have no love for the tarnished, but Moog does, he says. Incidentally, the tarnished are kind of related to Moog via Godfrey, in a way. We're all of the same bloodline, so I guess it is true that we are at least somewhat alike. Vare really is very loyal to Moog, and indeed, amongst all the war surgeons, Vare is actually the only one that's capable of incanting Bloodflame Blade, a spell that coats his weapon with what we know is the essence of the formless mother. Vare has been granted strength beyond any other character in Moog's dynasty, it seems, and Vare is no doubt eventually very disappointed in you. When you teleport to the palace early before the new dynasty has even begun This is what leads to an optional confrontation with Varee and his death Oh, Luminary Moog, please grant the strength you promised. I have given everything You can teleport to Moogwin Palace early with the Pureblood Knight's Medal Which is something Varee gives you if you prove yourself to him I've gone out of my way to provide one to you, but you mustn't use it just yet The meeting must wait until the Moogwin dynasty commences Luminary Moog yet slumbers beside the divinity Now that we've been inducted we start to see Moog's Luminary vision and can learn how Moogwin dynasty is supposed to come about The Lord of Blood's exultation talisman explains Reading, render up your offerings of blood to your lord, drench my consort's chamber, Slake his cocoon's thirst, his awakening shall herald the dawn of our dynasty So he's specifically saying that others should make offerings to Michaela And I think the ones he's telling to make the offerings would be his bloody fingers By Invading and killing. I think we might just be making offerings of others And I think also these offerings would be made by the Sanguine Nobles Who are just as aggressive as the bloody fingers are if you find them out in the open world For example, this is one of many Sanguine Nobles and you fight them here at the Rose Church in Leonia It's likely named after the Blood Rose which is an item deeply related to all things bloody The building itself is a sort of parish It's a church that operates in a foreign land and it's no coincidence that it's here that Vare Attempts to recruit you. In fact, the enemy inside the church is Supposedly a recruiter as well. Although I kind of question their recruiting techniques The Sanguine Noblehood is worn by nobles who serve the Lord of Blood and reads Known to strike from pools of blood. These assassins are missionaries come to share the gospel of accursed blood just like the Red Albinorex, the Sanguine Nobles have started to grow omen horns and their rank seems to exceed that of the Albinorex as can be inferred by the Noble in Mogwin Palace who stands before a crowd of Albinorex Again, rather than being true omen I think this is another instance where being infused with Moog's accursed blood has led to their horns growing a Cursed blessing as the Dung Eater would say Their robes go on to read the grand metallic pattern on the shoulder is a signifier of the noble rank they intend to claim upon the advent of the new dynasty they are working to install and Their weapons are designed to rip the flesh with sickening efficacy Suggesting that they really are working to install this new dynasty via the blood loss of others Making offerings for Michaela's cocoon and again, I think the bloody fingers are the same way Yura calls the bloody fingers tarnished held in thrall by cessblood zealots who stalk their own If it isn't Nereus The bloody finger the end is nigh for you Yura is familiar with many such bloody fingers None more so than Eleonora who is the one he loves and she's the one who he considers to be the deadliest Bloody finger of all I'm dying to see you Eleonora Violet bloody finger In the end though Eleonora kills Yura here at the second Church of Marika And this church is interesting because despite being a Church of Marika There's clearly been an attempt by Moog's adherents to usurp it Note the blood roses the sanguine noble who appears here the hound here festering with blood and of course Eleonora herself Eleonora is one of Moog's bloody fingers the most dangerous of them all if Yura is to be believed Perhaps it's for this reason that Moog might have entrusted her with the purifying crystal tear an item that can Nullify the effect of Moog's right of blood attack either that or she has somehow procured this purifying crystal tear because She has a secret plan to attack Moog. You could definitely speculate in that direction as well I think if you wanted to Eleonora wields a twinned naginata a weapon that's forged in the land of reeds Which is a place locked in civil war that has become alienated from the culture of its neighbors Little wonder it is said that the entire nation has succumbed to blood-soaked madness It's on this note that I'd again like to return to the description of formless Urdan in Bloodborne Specifically the part that says both Urdan and Urdan's inadvertent worshippers Surreptitiously seek the precious blood Earlier, we established that Urdan and the formless mother clearly have some overlap And I speculate that this overlap could extend to Urdan's inadvertent worshippers as well inadvertent means unintentional or Accidental worship in this context and I think that the formless mother might have many Many children because I think you can make a good case for her having many Inadvertent worshippers of her own after all the blood-soaked madness of the land of reeds Has led more than one of their number directly to Moog Introducing Okina who is a demon of a swordsman his bloodlust led him into combat with Moog himself And his sword tells of this story stating when Moog the lord of blood first felt Okina's sword and Madness upon his flesh he had a proposal to offer Okina the life of a demon whose thirst would never go Unsated so it was that Okina became a bloody finger of Moog Cutting down his enemies with rivers of blood a cursed sword which has felled countless men Weapons like these are really powerful when paired with the Lord of Bloods exaltation talisman which gives you an attack boost if blood loss is triggered in the vicinity and One amazing little lore detail is that this captain of Godric actually gets the attack power buff whenever there's blood loss nearby Hinting that he's actually carrying the Lord of Bloods Exaltation talisman and that he is thus an adherent of Moog the weapon art He uses bloody slash also suggests as much as it is a blood oath skill Granted by the Lord of Blood So it seems this storm veil captain has either defected or is Secretly loyal to Moog or he has a dual allegiance. I love that. It's left open to your interpretation The talisman itself is dropped by Ezgar a priest of blood found in the catacombs below Laindelle The same place where Moog first met the mother of truth He wears the robes of an adherent of Moog Except for his great hood, which reads a burial shroud of sorts for those who discover at long last the truth They sought I think this could be hinting that Ezgar found the mother of truth here below But it's hard to say for sure Speaking of which it's unclear if Moog has ever shared the fact that he communes with the formless mother at all most worship of her appears to be really indirect and Bloodshed for the sake of bloodshed seems reason enough for her and those that perform it as well Perhaps it's for this reason that the all-knowing Casts doubt on Moog's title calling him the so-called Lord of blood So that's where the so-called Lord of blood was hiding himself, eh? Perhaps this lack of clarity about Moog's rule is why even item descriptions cast doubt on Moog who is the reigning Lord and hierarch of the coming dynasty of Mogwin or Perhaps a raving lunatic After all can blood offerings really lead to the awakening of Michaela? The remembrance of the blood lord does state that no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber He tried to share he received no response from the young Empyrean But Moog needs Michaela to awaken because Moog doesn't just want to be a ruler He wants legitimacy in the eyes of the world and Since Michaela is an Empyrean Eligible to be the god of this world. He could give Mogwin a Legitimacy that might match even the golden order which is structured in a similar way It has a lord and a god at the forefront So it's time to finally talk about Michaela for if he does awaken Then it's very likely that this will lead to the coming dynasty named Mogwin and Whatever nightmares that may bring Quinkway Whatever nightmares that may bring is an extremely ominous line Especially considering Michaela has a dreaming alter ego So to explain that quickly Like many other characters in the game Michaela has a duality to his character on one hand You have Michaela the unalloyed who helped his sister resist the effects of the scarlet rot Who grew a home for the low and the meek and who is cursed with eternal youth But then on the other hand Michaela is also Saint Trina a mysterious character that has powers relating to Sleep and dreams the symbol of their faith is this Trina's lily which dulls the senses preventing agitation and it's no coincidence that this lily is shaped just like Michaela's lily for the nascent Michaela is Saint Trina or their moonlighting as them in their dreams, so to speak and Whatever Saint Trina has been doing it's made a really good impression on a great many people The lands between is a pretty harrowing place after all and to get relief It seems some people have turned to Saint Trina whose lilies help them get away from it all priests of Saint Trina also exist Crafting sleep arrows to spread their teachings the sweet oblivion of sleep can become quite the habit Another such item is the sleep pot which says like a lullaby or a quagmire its light purple haze Irresistibly draws its victims down into sleep sweet dreams Incidentally the word lullaby brings to mind another piece of cut content to do with Michaela where the red-eyed merchants were once taught the song that they play in their tomb by a mysterious figure and Fittingly Saint Trina's full cut name is Saint Trina of the cradle song which connects them to the merchants song in cut merchant dialogue It's stated that the one who sang for them now sings no longer The singer is missing just like Saint Trina because the one who sang was Saint Trina and we don't really have to just rely on cut content to tell us of that fact an item called Favors cookbook suggests that Saint Trina is missing as well as it is a record of crafting techniques Left by a man who was utterly captivated by Saint Trina He continued the search for her in his slumber. So he was searching for her because Saint Trina went missing Also, Saint Trina's sword reads Saint Trina is an enigmatic figure Some say she is a comely young girl others are sure he is a boy The only certainty is that their appearance was as sudden as their disappearance So Saint Trina went missing and returning to cut dialogue we also learn about a character called Rico a cut NPC who claims to be Michaela's humble servant and Who we believe finds Michaela's body at Moog's palace Here Rico states Finally, I have found it. Saint Trina. No Lord Michaela's cadaver I have partaken of untold secrets such that I may aid you Oh Lord So, please I hope you welcome your humble servant Rico into your dream the world of your heart so Rico believed that he was finally going to be able to aid Michaela and Enter his dream now that he'd found him in the physical world Before the DLC trailer was revealed. I would have said yeah I reckon the DLC will take us to Michaela's dream world. It sounds like the perfect place for DLC, right? But now with the recent trailer It can't be that simple because the interviews featured in my DLC video make it quite clear that Michaela's cadaver will instead take us to the land of shadow a Place that was once physically a part of the lands between Before it was veiled and obscured by Queen Marika in that video We speculated that the land of shadow might be a place where the dead go We speculated that it might be a kind of afterlife or at least it might have once been a sort of afterlife Before the earth tree sort of took over that role We reasoned this because Michaela is said to have Divested himself of his flesh to get there. The poem reads it was to this land that Michaela departed Divesting himself of his flesh his strength his lineage of all things golden Of course, we don't yet know the true nature of the land of shadow But it is kind of fitting for Saint Trina of all people to have died to arrive in this place Because death in Elden Ring has long been linked to sleep For example when Roger succumbs to death root. He says this Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice of falling into a deep Fathomless slumber and I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you somehow Roger is almost hinting that he might be a threat in some realm beyond sleep And he's kind of right because later we do find Roger or a part of his vitality at least which has been weaponized by fear We do this inside of Godwin's deathbed dream a phrase that obviously has sleep connotations as well So I wonder with death being so linked to sleep Could Michaela have planned this death in his own slumber so that he could travel to the land of shadow? One piece of evidence for Michaela's death being a sort of deep sleep could be the slumbering egg Which is an owl egg that will never hatch Prized as a symbol of the most sublime slumber The egg is this powerful parallel to the situation with Michaela's cocoon Michaela's cocoon was taken by Moog before it was ready to hatch Just so this egg is looted from killing an owl and thus is also taken before it was ready to hatch Perhaps before it was even ready to be born. The owl inside will never hatch. It's essentially dead and This eggs description reminds us that this state of death is the most sublime slumber there is So I conclude that there's a strong parallel between the slumbering egg and Michaela's cocoon Touching the arm that extends out of the cocoon will bring us to the land of shadow where Michaela traveled long before us as per the IGN interview Miyazaki states that players will be following in Michaela's footsteps in the same way that they followed the blessings of the sites of grace in the lands between and Of course the player is not the only one who is curious about Michaela There are several other characters in the world and NPCs who have been following Michaela as well And the player will encounter them on their journey in the land of shadow, and they will make new friends and enemies, we hope. Fittingly, Michaela does have many followers, so does Saint Trina, and while no one seems to know for sure where they disappeared to, it is rumoured. Gideon's dialogue reveals that he suspected Michaela was with the Lord of Blood, and there's even a phantom in the consecrated snowfield who points towards Mogwen Palace's waygate, and they died knowing exactly who took Michaela as well. And then of course, there's Rico, that cut content character who senses their master needs their aid. Indeed, Saint Trina and Michaela seem to live on, beyond the death of their flesh. And while the land of shadow might not literally be the dreamworld that many expected it to be, there is evidence that Saint Trina's presence has been felt here. For example, this is Saint Trina's lily in the base game. It looks a bit sad, right? It only has a tiny hint of purple left. So this is why I wonder, could this lily in the background be a true lily of Saint Trina? It does appear to be more whole, and it appears in a sort of quagmire of sleep here. There's that signature purple sleep hue, and there's a masked character who is slumbering in this place. Incidentally, another thing I missed was that you can actually spy some lilies in the background of this fight as well. So perhaps this boss is linked to Saint Trina? But I digress. Michaela's actions are becoming clearer to us. But that still leaves Mog. First up, how did Mog manage to abduct Michaela? Well, earlier we talked about how Mog abducted the war surgeons, presumably to test the accursed blood on them. So already Mog has a bit of a history of abduction, and if he can materialise from blood anywhere, like this cutscene suggests, and like his sanguine nobles and bloody fingers seem able to do, that would certainly explain how abducting Michaela was relatively easy for him, especially if Melania was away fighting Radan at the time. So during Michaela's abduction, he was ripped out of the tree. There's clearly a large gap here in the tree-like woman's form, almost as if this figure was pregnant with Michaela. Indeed, Michaela sits atop a giant pelvis bone in Mog's palace, showing just how wholesale he was ripped from the Helic Tree itself. The Mother of Truth desires a wound, indeed. So we know what happened, but why? Why did Mog think abducting Michaela was a good idea? Mog believed Michaela could have transitioned from Empyrean to God. Maybe even Michaela believed he could. And Mog wanted to take advantage of this process, and take advantage of the new God that would soon rise. The Remembrance of the Blood Lord reads, Wishing to raise Michaela to full godhood, Mog wished to become his consort, taking the role of monarch. But no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber he tried to share, he received no response from the young Empyrean. The wording of bedchamber is appropriate, considering Mog is trying to consort with Michaela, and become his lord, so to speak. And it being a bloody bedchamber is appropriate too, as items state that Mog slumbers beside the divinity, and the cutscene seems to be suggesting that Mog slumbers inside of Michaela's blood. Also, it's very fitting that they use the word slumber here. So if Mog becomes his consort, then Mog will become a lord of sorts, not unlike the dynamic with the Elden Lord that has existed throughout history, where they become consort to their god. But the real question that remains is, how exactly does Michaela become a god in this situation? Considering Michaela's positioning in the womb of this giant tree-like woman, it's easy to assume that what he was attempting was a sort of rebirth here. And this brings me back to Rico's dialogue, the final part, where he says Indeed I beg you grant my wish, that when you transcend from Empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side. I wonder, what if the cocoon was part of this transition? It reminds me a lot of Berserk, which Miyazaki is endlessly inspired by, and spoiler alert if you haven't yet seen it, but a certain character here also achieves a similar transition, inside an egg, turning from human to a god of sorts. To become a part of the god hand in this moment, and achieve his dream, Griffith has to make a sacrifice, and in the end, he chooses to betray his companions, branding them and sealing their fate. In my Michaela video, we draw a few parallels between Michaela and Griffith, and if Michaela is inspired by Griffith as much as I think, then that could be quite concerning, as there is a part of Melania's storyline as well that also seems to be setting up some betrayal to come, although that is of course just speculation. This is probably a good time to talk about the fact that Michaela does have some very ominous overtones to their character. For starters, Saint Trina has an adult form, and it's a one-eyed creature with this spooky mass of elevated hair that is carved upon Saint Trina's torch. What's more, remember, Saint Trina's sleep fog draws others down into sleep against their will. Sleep is a weapon. Saint Trina's sword makes that even more clear, as does cut content, which states, The Saint of the Cradle Song has become the very symbol of lost repose, and the feeble of heart were powerless to resist her kindness, even upon the battlefield. So in cut content, at least, the Saint of the Cradle Song actually fought in certain wars with kindness. So that description mentions Saint Trina's weaponised kindness, and so does this line from the trailer. Pure and radiant, he wields love to shrive clean the hearts of men. There is nothing more terrifying. Millenia also calls Michaela the most fearsome Empyrean of all. And lastly, the common soldiers of the Halyk Tree discovered a bitter truth as they awaited their lord's return to the Halyk Tree. They discovered that Michaela's sacred light would trigger them to self-destruct in their final moments, but even so, they remained loyal, and I quote, May the flash of our deaths guide Michaela's return. So in conclusion, it's for these reasons that I'm a bit concerned about this scary, dreaming demigod, and about the nightmares that might be incurred by Moog's ritual with him inside the cocoon. A part of me wonders if the formless mother was supposed to be a part of Michaela's ascension to god, considering the ritual happening in Mogwen Palace. That would fit, because a few gods we see in Elden Ring do have an outer god as a patron of sorts. Millenia has the outer god of rot, and she is destined to become the goddess of rot. Marika becomes a vessel for the Elden Ring, and she is the god of the greater will, who is almost certainly an outer god as well. So all of that sort of answers how Michaela might become a god, as best we can, considering how abstract the game is with these terms. My next question is though, did Michaela foresee any of this happening? The Bewitching Branch is an item that can pierce a foe and turn them into a temporary ally, and it reads, The Empyrean Michaela is loved by many people. Indeed, he has learned very well how to compel such affection. The wording here is kind of sinister, right? The fact that Michaela is capable of consciously compelling affection in order to get what he wants is very manipulative. And if Michaela is capable of masterminding others' affections, who's to say he hasn't done the same with Moog? Moog's infatuation with Michaela is very obvious, and very cursed, considering Michaela's eternal youth, and the fact that Michaela is technically Moog's half-brother. Again, I'm reminded of this scene with Griffith from Berserk, where Griffith spends a night with a powerful, perverted older man for money, which he needs to achieve his own goals. The man, Genon, is obsessed with Griffith. But to Griffith, Genon is nothing more than a stone lying on the side of the path he walks, and Griffith eventually discards him as such. In my Michaela video, we talked about just how much overlap there is between the characters of Michaela and Griffith, and so I just can't shake the feeling that Michaela might be using Moog here. But if that's true, why? What would Michaela stand to gain from masterminding this entire situation where he ends up dead and defiled? Before the DLC trailer dropped, I had imagined that Michaela's arm would take us into Michaela's dream world, and so I thought that Michaela might stand to benefit, or suffer, thanks to Moog's actions upon his slumbering form. I thought he might have even been co-opting the formless mother for his ascension into a god. But now, from what we understand about the DLC trailer, the Land of Shadow is a place distinct from Michaela, so the answer becomes different. We know Michaela divested himself of his flesh and grace to get here, so it's harder to imagine that the bloody rituals happening in Moguen are having any effect on Michaela's self. Moog really might not be getting any response from Michaela for good reason. So I'm gonna present one new theory on why Michaela might benefit from being here based on the information we have from the DLC trailer, and it's this. So we know Michaela divested himself of his flesh before reaching the Land of Shadow, right? And we know that he also divested himself of his grace to get here. He divested himself of his lineage, of all things golden. Divesting yourself of your flesh is hard enough, but divesting yourself of your grace is also difficult. Ranni has difficulty with this in her questline. She divests herself of her flesh, finally, but even then she's still linked to the two fingers and has to kill them to be freed completely. So what if Moog was instrumental not just to the process of Michaela dying, but the process of Michaela losing his grace as well? What if, by being doused in Accursed Blood, Michaela was defiled to the point that grace left him fully? We know that those doused in Moog's Accursed Blood start to grow omen horns, and the omen are graceless, and we know that being defiled is something that many people in the Lands Between fear. The Dung Eater is proof of that. We talked earlier about how they defile people, and how those people are terrified of what this means for them, and their rebirth. So it is that I think that Michaela might have wanted to die in this manner, to fall into this state of sublime slumber, and also to be defiled to the point where grace leaves him. But that's just a theory, and of course, we don't have all of the pieces of the story yet, and I think it's impossible to say for sure which direction his story will go. I think this state of speculation is very much exactly where FromSoftware wants us to be at this point. Even the all-knowing doesn't know what's going on here. So Michaela was with the Lord of Blood after all, that is some fine intelligence indeed. Well I wonder what comes next, if he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well. But perhaps it will be safer to destroy it. Michaela is the one thing that remains a mystery to me. So what do you think? Did Michaela anticipate being taken from the Halyx tree? Will he be affected by the Lord of Blood's machinations? Moog certainly believes so. In fact, Moog believes this even beyond the very moment of his death. I can see it, as clear as day, the coming of our dynasty, Morgwyrn. Before I go, let me tell you a little story about a game that was scheduled to release on June 21st. So this is Innotria, a souls-like title inspired by Italian folklore and history, which gives it an extremely unique vibe. For example, this is Quinta, the game's opening area, rendered gorgeously in Unreal Engine 5 here. I love the verticality in these scenes, I think there's gonna be so much level design they can play with there, and I was very excited to explore this Mediterranean world. But then, Elden Ring announced its DLC for the same day as their release. Oof. Luckily, however, I've heard they're announcing a new release date soon. Now, I don't usually take souls-like sponsorships unless it's something I've played and loved, but since the devs for this game weren't strict on what I had to say here, I decided to take this one, because they're clearly happy for their product to speak for itself, and I think that kind of confidence is awesome. Their gameplay trailer mentions huge skill trees, spells, buffs, passives, and a special type of equipment called masks, which are at the centre point of each loadout. They've also said that they've spent a lot of time getting the motion capture for animations right, which is potentially the most important thing for a souls-like for me, and their gameplay system also builds in something called chainable parries, which reminds me a lot of Sekiro, which I love. So, if you like what you see, consider following some of their pages, or even pre-ordering.

      "[Doc 13: The Lore of Elden Ring is Blasphemous]\n",
      "The god of Mount Gelmir is a serpent, and it has been there for a long time. Long before the age of the Ode Tree, in an era we know little about, there was an ancient, immortal serpent deity on Mount Gelmir, and a forgotten religion that venerated it. We learn this from the Serpent God's curved sword, which was a tool used to offer up sacrifices, fashioned in the image of the ancient serpent deity. The serpent takes. The serpent is greed. It always has been, ever since Dark Souls, where the serpent was a symbol of avarice. And so, in the ancient age of Elden Ring, the serpent consumed its sacrifices and grew vast. But there were those who would not stand for it. They brandished the Serpent Hunter, a weapon that is both greatsword and spear. Thought to have been used to hunt an immortal great serpent in the distant past, it manifests a blade of light when facing such a creature. So it is that we can speculate that the serpent deity was defeated. But the serpent never dies, and so it would return one day to feast upon a demigod, who had ventured deep into Mount Gelmir, seeking power. This is a video about the blasphemy of Praetor Reikard, the demigod child of Radagon and Rennala, who would one day be consumed by the immortal serpent. THE CHURCH OF VOWS Here, at the Church of Vows in Leonia, the House of the Ode Tree and the Moon were joined. Radagon, Champion of Gold, and Rennala, Queen of Caria, were wedded. This ended a war between Leonia and Leyndell. Eventually, Radagon would abandon Rennala, but not before siring three children with her. These children were Ranni, Radan, and Reikard. All three were born with Radagon's red hair and Rennala's aptitude for magic, and all three officially became demigod stepchildren, when Radagon divorced their mother and married the goddess Marika instead. In truth, however, Rennala's children were never demigod stepchildren, they were demigod children, full stop. That's because, secretly, Radagon is Marika. Thus, Ranni, Radan, and Reikard always were born of a god, even though they might not have known it. Their father remarrying with a god conferred some benefits, it seems. For one, Radagon's children would be honoured enough to sit equally aside their step-siblings in Leyndell. This is shown during Morgoth's cutscene. The way these thrones are arranged, it's almost as if there was once a council here, of sorts. Now, of course, there is no council, and Morgoth spits out their names, as he considers all of the demigods to be traitors to the positions of authority they once held. General Radan. Praetor Reikard. Lunar Princess Ranni. Reikard having the title of Praetor in the days where he sat this throne is an extremely interesting point of discussion. Praetor is a word that has its origins in the city of ancient Rome, where a Praetor was a sort of magistrate, someone who exercised authority from a courthouse, and its collection of judges. By some Roman accounts, Praetors were not just involved with the law, but were also involved with commanding armies and conducting war, though it might be a stretch to say that Reikard had that much authority. Instead, I think it's safer to assume that Reikard's Praetorship was busied with discovering the truth, and administering justice, by any means necessary. And I feel safe levelling this characterisation at him because of Gideon. Praetor Reikard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mount Gelmir. He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors. So, Reikard wasn't just a Praetor, and a justiciar, he was also Lord of the Volcano Manor, a structure built into the very side of the volcano to the west of Altus Plateau. It was to here, I believe, that Leyndell outsourced much of their justice, and I think that theory will make more sense as we go. So let's investigate the manor, and try to learn more about Reikard as he was before the Shattering, when we think he still served Leyndell. To arrive at the manor, one commonly first receives an invitation. Upon arrival, you're met with a well-maintained grandeur not common to Elden Ring's other castles. Clearly, first impressions are important here. You make your way in, head up to the banquet hall, and before long, you're invaded by the spectre of one of Reikard's most loyal inquisitors. This is Inquisitor Giza, and his lore reveals just how ruthless Reikard's inquisitions were. His weapon of choice is an iron wheel, lined with flesh-flaying blades, that cause severe pain and blood loss. It's a device of torture that kind of evokes the torture wheels of antiquity, an intimidating tool that was likely very effective at getting Giza's victims to tell the truth. And if you're asking, what truth? Well, I imagine Leyndell would have had a lot of truths that it would like to extract from its populace, for it sees many things as sins. For example, if you were Omen, you were to be hunted or sent to the Shunning Grounds. If you were a prophet who saw the Urd Tree burn in your visions, then you could be exiled with a wheel bolted to your neck. If you were suspected of conspiring with the Frenzied Flame, you could get your entire clan entombed beneath the earth for eternity. So, yeah, the Golden Order isn't exactly flexible. And sure, Mirial tells us that heresy can be conjoined with order, but historically, that was only true if your heresy was such a threat to the Urd Tree that it couldn't be overcome any other way. Aside from Giza's signature wheel, a more common weapon of the Inquisitors was the Inquisitor's Jirindol, which has numerous spikes that pierce the flesh, then singe the wounds with flame. Basically, it creates a wound, then immediately cauterizes it so that the torture can continue for longer. The smell of burnt blood induces despair in the victim, and this candlestick, conceived by a thorough mind, was explicitly used on nobles behind the curtain at the Volcano Manor. Now, the word noble in Elden Ring doesn't really relate to any one faction. There are godskin nobles, sanguine nobles, and many others besides. That said, the most common nobles are those from the capital, who, according to the old aristocrat Kal, are undead wanderers who abandoned their birthplace after the Shattering. Of all the nobles in Elden Ring that the Inquisitor's Jirindol would have been used on, I believe it was these citizens of Leyndell. So, for the last few minutes, I've made it pretty obvious that I believe Rykard was spiriting away nobles from Leyndell to torture at the Volcano Manor on behalf of Leyndell. I believe this happened during his tenure at Leyndell as Praetor, not after the Shattering when he abandoned the capital. But is there actually any explicit evidence of Rykard controlling the Volcano Manor while he was still serving Leyndell before the Shattering? Well, yes, but it's mostly circumstantial evidence. Here's a short list. First, it's implied from Morgoth's dialogue, at least, that Rykard was a Praetor while he had a throne in Leyndell. So, there's that. Next, we know Rykard's Inquisitors tortured nobles with a candlestick weapon that looks very much inspired by the fire of Mount Gelmir, so I think that's another piece of evidence that links the Volcano Manor with his Praetorship in Leyndell. Then, there's Rykard's Gelmir Knights, who have a crest of red feathers that symbolize Rykard's pedigree as Lord Radagon's son. There's a veneration here of Radagon of the Golden Order, and the Knights were explicitly loyal to Praetor Rykard before he became the blasphemous Lord Rykard, so I think this is another small piece of evidence that suggests the Volcano Manor at Mount Gelmir was kind of a vassal state to Leyndell. But, admittedly, none of this is conclusive. However, we haven't yet discussed the official's attire. The official's attire is a piece of clothing we loot in an office of Leyndell. When worn, you realize it's a near-perfect match for the attire that Giza wears, and it also matches the attire of this nameless figure in a portrait that hangs over the banquet hall that Giza invades. Yet again, we have a link, now between the officials of Leyndell and the Inquisitors of the Manor. So who is this portraited figure? Why is Giza wearing a similar set? And why is Giza's attire found in Leyndell? The lore of the official's attire reads To loot this item, we have to access a lift to the east of Leyndell. Here, right on the border of these forbidden lands, halfway up the elevator, there's a hidden path that leads towards a small office, and that's where we find the body of one who previously wore this attire. Ahead of them is the small room, one that's quite well furnished, and it's here, presumably, that this official would have furtively administered their dark duties, which, again, included surveillance, executions, and gruesome rituals. Given the location, these tasks would have been done in the service of Leyndell, you'd think. Incidentally, this is also where we loot the Blade of Calling, the same dagger that Melina wields, which was given to one who set out on a journey to fulfill her duty long ago. Perhaps the implication here is that this hidden office of Leyndell was involved with Melina's own grim storyline, but that's probably the topic for another video. The big deal here is that Inquisitor Giza also wears the official's attire, which links him, an Inquisitor of Reikard, to the magisterial officials, just like this one, who drive the wheels of mankind behind the scenes in Leyndell, with their surveillance, executions, and rituals. Thus, as befits a Praetor, I think it's fair to assume that Reikard and his Inquisition really were involved with the governance of Leyndell on a deeper level. But the shadow cast by these officials doesn't just cover Leyndell and the Volcano Manor. I think the origins of their attire and their order can actually be traced to the Shaded Castle and the Mirai, who occupy a nearby township. The reason I speculate this is that Giza isn't just wearing the official's chest piece. In fact, every other slot is filled with the blood-soaked set instead. These are nothing more than tightly wound bandages soaked through with blood, which hide the ghastly, festering body beneath. The clear implication here is that Inquisitor Giza is very, very sick. Indeed, a reveal of his face by Zullie the Witch shows his scars, and a mere stone's throw away is the Shaded Castle, which explains it all. The Castellans of the Shaded Castle are the Mirai family, who have this long, storied history. We learn about it from the Mirai Mask, which lets us know that these Castellans of the Shaded Castle have also served as executioners for generations. This mask is customarily worn by the head of House Mirai. Similar to the blood-soaked wraps that Giza wears, I think it's a convenient way to hide the festering skin beneath, as it's well known that the sons of House Mirai are all sickly born. We learn this from the Mirai Robe, which is attire that is almost identical to the official's attire. The only difference is that it has this black mantle across the shoulders. And the Mirai Robe, combined with the mask, also looks strikingly similar to this portrait in the Volcano Manor, where Inquisitor Giza invaded you. There's just so much overlap here. But to summarize, House Mirai are Lords of the Shaded Castle, where they are sickly born and have served as executioners. The attire of their Lords is almost identical to the attire of the officials who served Leyndell, who were also involved in executions, as well as surveillance and gruesome rituals. Therefore, I think it's fair to assume that House Mirai aided Leyndell in these dark capacities. And since one of Praetor Rykard's Inquisitors also wears the Leyndell official's set, and is sick with blood-soaked manchettes and a portrait nearby that looks like a Mirai noble, I also think it's fair to assume that this Inquisitor, and maybe others, were not only loyal to Leyndell, but originally hailed from the Shaded Castle as well. And all of them would have been loyal to Rykard, who was a Praetor and a Justitia, someone who would have been involved in magisterial and punitive duties on behalf of his Queen Mother and Lord Father in Leyndell. I love the picture that this all paints, and I love how geographically that story plays out. The Shaded Castle is a part of Altus Plateau, after all, so of course the Mirai family would be assimilated by the local superpower and become a part of the Leyndell nobility as the Age of the Erd Tree began. Indeed, the attire of the Mirai and the officials also closely matched that of the Consort's robe and the upper-class robe, revealing the higher status of these folk. So we think these Leyndell officials were tasked with surveilling the rest of the noble populace, and I like to imagine that they invited many nobles, particularly ones they were investigating, to the Volcano Manor to dine or die, perhaps with the same sort of letters that we receive. Upon arrival, the nobles are received by the proprietress of the house, and they marvel at the drawing room, a place that's designed to receive and entertain guests. There's a huge round table here, a gorgeous dining room upstairs, a living room to the side, and even smaller, more intimate rooms that guests can retire to. However, a couple of these rooms hide a secret, and it's that they have illusory walls that lead to a dungeon and a world of torture and pain. For the Volcano Manor is merely a facade, and these rooms likely exist for the express purpose of spiriting nobles away for interrogation. So we've established that Rikard's Inquisition was deeply involved in surveillance, questioning, and justice, and because of this, you'd think Rikard would have been exposed to the most cardinal sins of the populace. So I wonder, is it possible that these blasphemous ideas started to get through to him? Did Rikard spy an element of truth in their words? There is a portrait of the Urd Tree burning, hanging in Volcano Manor, so I wonder, for example, if he started to believe in the visions that the prophets kept on having about the Urd Tree on fire. If we imagine that Rikard was exposed to all of these blasphemies, perhaps it's not so ironic to think that this justiciar would eventually become the most blasphemous of them all. What's more, the current Elden Lord of Leyndell, Radagon, had abandoned Rikard's mother and left her a broken woman. Now I'm just speculating here, but perhaps this betrayal to marry Marika in Leyndell didn't sit right with Ranala's own children. Luckily for Rikard, another of his siblings was harboring resentment towards the Golden Order, and she planned to do something about it. According to Regere, Ranni orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives, a plot that allegedly was the catalyst for the shattering of the Elden Ring since it resulted in the death of a demigod. To orchestrate something is to plan or coordinate or... of the elements, and Ranni wasn't acting alone. She had help. First and foremost, there was the assistance of the Black Knife Assassins, who used black knives infused with death to murder Godwin the Golden. Then, she might have had help in the forging of the Rune of Death into knives, which we speculate could have required Iji, a blacksmith. Then there's the matter of the theft of the Rune of Death itself, which Ranni herself takes credit for..but one thing I feel it's easy to miss is that Rykard might have helped with her plot as well. The Blasphemous Claw is an item we receive from one of Rykard's recusants, and it reads A slab of rock engraved with traces of the Rune of Death can deflect the power of the Black Blade. On the night of the dire plot, Ranni rewarded Praetor Rykard with these traces. Should the coming trespass one day transpire, they would serve as a last resort foil, allowing Rykard to challenge the Black Blade, the black beast of destined death. So it is that we learn Ranni rewarded her brother, at the end of her plot to murder Godwin the Golden. The word reward seems to imply that Rykard had some part in all of this, and that maybe he did something worthy of recompense. So what do we think Rykard could have conceivably done to help with the Night of the Black Knives? One of my favourite theories comes from Loki, who brought up Rykard's magisterial duties in Leyndell. Since Ranni's forces would have needed to break into the city, to murder Godwin the Golden, and perhaps even to steal a fragment of the Rune of Death in the first place, it makes sense that Praetor Rykard would have been a good ally to have in this moment, since he likely had authority over law and order here. So perhaps Rykard arranged for security to be lax on the Night of the Black Knives, or perhaps he gave Ranni's crew intel about the city's defences. And if you subscribed to the idea that Rykard's Praetorship involved control of the army, like some of the old Roman Praetors had, then that definitely would have helped as well. Of course, how Rykard earned his reward is very open to speculation, but we definitely know that he was deemed worthy of this reward, and that gives us a lot to work with. For example, it also tells us that Ranni knew about Rykard's blasphemous intentions before the Shattering. Hell, maybe merely harbouring blasphemous thoughts was worthy of a reward in Ranni's eyes. And what she gave was a valuable reward, the Blasphemous Claw. It wards off Malekith's Black Blade of Destined Death, which posed the single greatest threat to the demigods, especially to one as blasphemous as Rykard. One thing I kind of love about Rykard is that, as blasphemous as he was, even in his later years, he still keeps a portrait of his brother Radahn, hanging in the Volcano Manor. Radahn, by all accounts, was a bit of a Golden Order fanboy, with armour that symbolised Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, and the red hair of Radagon, which he was keen to show off. You'd think then that this would be a painting worthy of being taken down. Hell, there's literally a painting of a burning Erd tree in the same building, and yet the portrait remains. Perhaps there was a kinship between these, the children of Ranala, that superseded their differences. What I'm trying to say is that I think Rykard really loves his family. Sorry. In general, though, kinships between the demigods generally went out the door when the Shattering occurred, as Marika's remaining kin claimed the great runes of the shattered Elden Ring. With words such as these, and with the power split to all the demigods with the great runes, it's clear that Marika was laying the groundwork for a greater descent, and a more pronounced Shattering War. Of course, many did go to war for their demigod's unique ambition. Godric the Golden tried, and failed, to take back the capital, and he was repelled by Morgoth, the new, grace-given Lord of Leyndell, and many troops would have died in this battle. Redan's Redmane Knights also clashed with Melania's Cleanrot Knights, which caused the Scarlet Bloom in Caled, and when the war efforts were spent, many demigods retreated back to their domains to lick their wounds, essentially. Rykard, for his part, clearly doubled down on Mount Gelmir, as his domain during this time. Between all of the demigod ambitions on display during the Shattering, I think Rykard's would have stood out for one unique reason, and it's that he didn't rest control of the Golden Order, he wanted to rise against the Ord Tree, and tear it all down. Before release, Miyazaki has gone on record stating, As for Rikard, in a way, I feel that his blasphemy represents one of the strongest wills in Elden Ring. To put it in grandiose terms, I find his determination and commitment almost enviable. So even Miyazaki sounds pretty sold on Rikard. I imagine his troops were as well. Indeed, both descriptions within the Gelmir Knight sets mention their loyalty to Rikard and his lofty ambitions. These descriptions, as well as dialogue from Banal and the ex-Gelmir Knight, all mention Rikard's dignity and worth. But of course, it would all go to hell in the end. A fine mess. But how else could it end? When daddy ambitions head over heels courting lady blasphemy? So this is Rikard at his height. Now let's talk about before. Before At some point, Rikard delved deeper into the mountain, and what he found would change him forever. For Mount Gelmir contains truly ancient things, artifacts, and religion, and a creature that history barely talks about. The most important description comes from the Serpent God's curved sword, a weapon that was formerly used to offer up sacrifices. It was a tool of a forgotten religion. Once practiced on Mount Gelmir, and considering the sword's design is a serpent's jaw that consumes the vitality of enemies, we can guess who the sacrifices were being made to. This culture of sacrifice helps us to explain another ancient discovery Rikard made within Mount Gelmir, hexes. Typically in FromSoftware games, a hex is a type of death magic, which often manifests as a skull flying towards enemies. In Elden Ring, this tracks as well. The death hexes of the death birds, for example, summon a horde of vengeful spirits, as does Rikard's ranker. To be even more specific though, hexes in Elden Ring all seem to involve sacrifice in some way. The Staff of the Guilty talks about this. It's a heretical staff, fashioned from a smouldering withered sapling, with a little creature impaled on the end. The creature is a sacrifice that has had its blood turned into red glintstone, and the staff says that this process of sacrifice is similar to hex magic. This sacrificial process might also explain why hexes manifest as rancorous spirits. If you were being sacrificed, I imagine that would put you in a pretty vengeful mood after death. But with the age of the Ood Tree usurping so many prior cultures of death, it seems hexes haven't been seen in the world of Elden Ring for quite some time. For instance, do you recall fighting Necromancer Garrus? He's this sage who fights you in this cave at the base of Mount Gilmere. Garrus is described as a heretical sage, and his heresy is clearly that he's researching death rituals that run counter to those of the Ood Tree. One of Garrus' achievements is the rankercore sorcery. Once thought lost, this ancient death hex was rediscovered by the Necromancer Garrus. Incidentally, his little snail buddies in this fight are actually snakes, who are merely wearing skulls as their shell. They're similar to the spiritcaller snails, who are also snakes that are able to summon spirits. I don't think it's a coincidence that all of these snail snakes are so death-themed. I think the Great Serpent and its kin were a big part of the sacrificial culture that existed in Mount Gilmere long ago, and I don't think it's a coincidence either that Garrus rediscovered an ancient death hex so close to Mount Gilmere, especially since Reikard himself would go on to rediscover ancient hexes at Mount Gilmere as well. As a child of Rinala, Reikard clearly had a knack for sorceries, and he developed many from the Magma of Mount Gilmere. The Magma Shot Sorcery reads, After discovering the ancient hexes of Gilmere, Reikard, son of Queen Rinala, brought them back into practical use as new forms of sorcery. In this sense, magma sorceries are kind of a type of hex magic. The volcano is the Great Serpent's home, magma is its aspect, so maybe lava sorceries, being a type of hex magic, has something to do with all of the sacrifices that had been made to the Serpent God here. So we've established that magma is an aspect of the Serpent, and so were hexes, but there's a third aspect, poison. The Man Serpent's inflict it, as does the Coil Shield, the Serpent Bone Blade, and the Serpent Bow and Arrows. Plus, of course, the God-devouring Serpent itself spits a great deal of poison at you during its boss fight. Considering this, I wonder if Mount Gilmere is somehow the source of the poison that has pooled at the Shaded Castle. Now, you could argue that this poison here is different, and that this is more of a poison that's born of stagnant, unmoving water, but I don't think that's the case. I think there's a couple of things that suggest this poisoned water comes from Mount Gilmere, perhaps even from the Great Serpent itself. To start, there's actually a link between the Mirai and the Serpent that I don't think many people know about. The cut description of the Serpent Arrow reads, Arrow carved to resemble a slender serpent, its fangs adorbed with a fast-acting venom. These arrows were used by the people of the Shaded Castle, making them all the more hated by their enemies. The Serpent Bow then elaborates, stating that it was used by heretical assassins, and then the release version of the Serpent Bow specifies that these assassins were known as the Formless Serpents, with a bow that supernaturally infuses any arrow with poison. So yeah, there was once a lot of overlap between the Mirai and the Serpent. I looked up this cut description to see if anyone else had commented on this connection, and I stumbled upon some comments by reddit user Narmagrah, who had made some excellent observations about how serpent worship might have influenced the culture of the Mirai family. I'll leave a link to their ideas in the description, but basically, they argue that the Mirai might have been a part of the sacrificial execution rituals that we know took place at Mount Gelmir in the ancient past, since the Mirai culture in the current age also involves execution as a family tradition, a tradition that was eventually put to use on behalf of Leyndell. To add some more support of my own to this theory, the sacrificial blade, once used for offerings to the serpent, is a weapon that's meant to be wielded by humans, so it would make sense that humans, maybe the Mirai clan, might have once been in charge of such sacrificial executions. Again, all of this is cut content, but I think it might give us a valuable insight into what the devs were thinking when they designed the Mirai family. Anyway, to bring things back around to my original point, I think all of this is at the very least decent proof that the poison in this environment evokes the Great Serpent, and I think it's decent proof that this poison probably flows from Mount Gelmir, which is the Great Serpent's home. This brings us to Seath Water Cave, brimming with poison, with a name that implies poisoned water is seething and flowing underground. It's located here on the northeastern side of Mount Gelmir, and the most curious thing about this cave, I think, is that it's located directly below a minor herd tree, and this minor herd tree is dead. So, I'd like to propose a bit of a theory. I think this tree might be dead, at least partly because of the poison at its roots. I think the Volcano Manor wanted this tree dead, and I think that this desecration of an herd tree was the catalyst for the terrible war that would come to this region. So, let me expand on that a little bit. First, what are the minor herd trees? Well, it seems they only came to exist after the Shattering. This is explained by the Golden Seed description, which reads, When the Elden Ring was shattered, these seeds flew from the Herd Tree, scattering across the various lands, as if life itself knew its end had come. The Seed Talismans go on to say that the Herd Tree was once perfect and eternal, and thus it was believed that Herd Tree seeds could not exist. But exist they did, eventually growing into Minor Herd Trees, that spread the ailing tree's influence farther across the lands between. And at the feet of Minor Herd Trees, basins were set up in order to collect their crystallized tears, which physic chemists would then use to brew powerful concoctions. And these Minor Herd Trees, these offspring of the Herd Tree, were defended by the Herd Tree Avatars and the Herd Tree Guardians. The Avatars seem born of the tree itself, and wield a ceremonial staff that depicts the Herd Tree in its historic radiance. They were determined to protect the withering Herd Tree's offspring in the wake of the Elden Ring's shattering. The Guardians, too, are clearly part tree, although their tree-like aspect seems like it has blossomed over time instead. These were probably humans originally, and their weapon says that they are known as experts in the art of combat. At some point, though, they made what is now an ancient pact with the Herd Tree, whereupon their deaths would lead not to destruction, but instead to renewed, eternal lives as Guardians. The description asserts that it is said that the blood-red flowers blooming on their backs mark the senescence, or deterioration, of that ancient pact. I think that's a sly reference to how the Herd Tree isn't really eternal, and thus, neither was their ancient pact. Incidentally, these Guardians are perhaps proof that the Herd Tree is capable of rebirth, something the community has long speculated about, based on some murals found in game. And I say that they're proof of rebirth, since their weapon description makes it clear that they had to die before they could be renewed as eternal minor ord tree guardians. But of all the minor ord trees to be renewed, to guard, I wouldn't have wanted to guard the one at Mount Gelmir. This one was growing right next to a faction that was becoming increasingly defined by their resistance to the ord tree, and while fear of repercussion might have protected this minor ord tree for a time, eventually its time ran out, and the ord tree was desecrated and killed. Now, it might be a stretch to say that this minor ord tree was poisoned intentionally, or even unintentionally, by the poison, at its roots in Seathwater Cave, but there are Leyndell knights and scouts who have ventured into Seathwater Cave, and while they could just be sheltering here, I like to think they're here to investigate how the minor ord tree died. Though, I should be clear, this is largely my own headcanon. You can speculate on a few ways this minor ord tree might have died. For example, maybe Reikard used the traces of the Rune of Death to bring down this ord tree. Since it's the unleashing of the Rune of Death that burns the actual ord tree later in our timeline, so why not use a minor piece of destined death to burn a minor ord tree? Whatever the case, this minor ord tree is dead, and all around it, we find the aftermath of a horrific battle. So considering fire and burning an ord tree would be a cardinal sin, I feel pretty convinced that the death of this minor ord tree might have been the catalyst for this, what Gideon calls the most appalling battle in the history of the Shattering. Now, Leyndell is all about defence, right? And there's evidence that it has successfully weathered many assaults upon its walls. It is said that the soldiers of Leyndell fight their battles defensively, and their purpose is to protect that which deserves protection, and thus, the shield always comes before the sword. The one exception to that, it seems, was the assault on Volcano Manor. Here, Leyndell actually launched an offensive. There are numbered sites of grace at Gelmir, called First Mount Gelmir Campsite, located here, and then there's Ninth Mount Gelmir Campsite, located here, and the fact that there were so many campsites clearly, I think, suggests a sort of slow progression in their campaign to assault Mount Gelmir. But the battle itself clearly took place here, leading up to the minor ord tree, where there are mountains of the dead, and the bodies of crucified giants and other folk. It's a pretty grim scene. The only note of brevity comes from the Jar Cannon, an experimental firearm brought to the assault on Volcano Manor, where it was discovered that no one knew how to use it. While that's kind of funny, the aftermath isn't. The dead are piled and rotting, and have been for quite a while. Bodies are even seen on both sides of a broken bridge here. And assuming they didn't just throw half the bodies off this broken bridge for some reason, I feel like another logical conclusion to draw is that the war occurred so long ago, and the bodies have been here for so long, that a land upheaval broke the bridge in two, and separated it with the bodies still upon it. We do learn from the Gelmir map that the land in this area has experienced such an upheaval, but please let me know if I'm missing something here. So basically, all of the living that fought on Reikard's side are dead and gone. But what about those who fought on his side, but were never alive? These are the Marionette soldiers, and they're commonly employed by sorcerers, so these soldiers likely belonged to Reikard, considering his heritage as Rennala's son. And they're the only ones that really fight on here now, since they're puppets, they're uncaring of their master's blasphemy, or the state of the battlefield. A nearby sword gravestone comments on the battle. The assault on Volcano Manor, the Squalid, the Sick, the Blasphemous. A wretched, unending war with no glory. The fact that the assault on Volcano Manor involved the Squalid and the Sick makes me think again of the Serpent's poison. Human defenders of the Manor in the current age do attack with poison pots, so it's not ridiculous to think that some sort of chemical warfare might have been used against the House of the Ode Tree in this wretched, unending war. Speaking of which, the nearby grace references the nearby Road of Iniquity. Iniquity is a word that means immoral, or grossly unfair behaviour, and I think we experience the aftermath of that iniquity first hand when we encounter this troll warrior. It's hard to say for sure which side this troll fought on, but I lean towards it fighting on Rykard's side, since it's flanked by marionette soldiers. Whatever the case, though, this troll warrior has seen some shit, and now it has eyes that burn with the flames of frenzy. Frenzy, as you might know from our Age of Despair video, is contagious, but it also commonly visits those who have simply experienced some sort of horror or despair. So it is with the troll here, and with many of the Leyndell Knights as well, who you find despairing around Mount Gelmir. A bunch of Leyndell Knights can even be found cannibalising their comrades, adding to the horror of this stage. So it's no wonder then that the land itself has even become afflicted, and Eyes of Yellow, which grow in lands afflicted by frenzy, have started to flourish in this place. A spirit, once allied with Rykard, muses on the squalor of this battlefield. I think this dialogue helps to sell the idea that morale was fading during the war, even amongst Rykard's faithful. But things would only get worse, as Rykard was about to feed himself to the Great Serpent. Perhaps I should clarify, at the time of the war, I don't think Rykard had yet fed himself to the Serpent. This is mostly because of Tanith. Tanith wears the Consort's robe, which reads, Long ago, when Rykard first set eyes on Tanith, she was working as a dancer in a foreign land. Soon he made her his consort. The description then goes on to state, She was the only human to remain by his side when he became the Serpent of Blasphemy. So, since Rykard supposedly had no more humans at his side when he became the Serpent, the war must have taken place before this transition, since he obviously still had humans at his side when he was fighting in the war. That said, you definitely could still argue that Rykard had already fed himself to the Serpent by the time of this war, and that's because of these tattered flags that fly over the battlefield. The symbol shows a depiction of Rykard and the Great Serpent. Not to mention, Giza, his inquisitor, had a weapon decorated with Serpent symbolism. So yeah, as it stands, I probably lean towards Rykard not having fed himself to the Serpent yet, I think maybe he was just enraptured with it, or maybe this Serpent symbolism on the banner and in Giza's weapon just showed up later in the timeline, closer to when we explore, but it's hard to say for sure. If you guys know the answer to this, feel free to let me know in the comments. Whatever the case, I do think this assault from Leyndell was the beginning of the end, and I think the final straw was when Rykard doubled down and fed himself to the Serpent, Great Rune and all. It was in this moment that Tanith was truly charmed by him. We know that Rykard delved into Mount Gelmeer, and came out with new Death Hex sorceries, but he must have uncovered a lot more within. Legends of an ancient culture of sacrifice, and a Serpent God that could not die. But why did Rykard feed himself to such a creature? Well, for one, it's certainly possible that losses from the assault from Leyndell factored into things. With his troops pushed to the brink, the Serpent might have represented a new promising path forward, but that's just speculation. In terms of concrete proof, we have the remembrance of the Blasphemous, which makes it very clear that Rykard took the form of a giant serpent that he might devour, grow and live eternally. Rykard is then quoted as saying, I understand. The road of blasphemy is long and perilous. One cannot walk it unprepared to sin. In the concept art for this scene, the so-called giant serpent consuming Rykard is actually pretty small, looking nowhere near as vast as the Great Serpent that we fight in game. But if this actually is the Great Serpent, well, it might make some sense that it would be this small in this scene. The Serpent Hunter seems to suggest the Great Serpent was actually defeated in the past, so maybe it was eventually reborn as a smaller creature, or diminished in size, and it's only now after consuming Rykard that it's able to begin growing back to its former glory. The details in this scene are amazing. If you look closely, you realise that Rykard literally served himself up on a golden platter to the snake. Off to the side, there are even a couple of what look like small eggs on a silver platter, and only one of them has hatched, so did the Great Serpent hatch from this egg? What about the other eggs? I don't really know what to make of this, but again, this scene is concept art, essentially, so maybe I shouldn't be taking it too literally. We also learn from the Devourer's Scepter that in his final moments, Rykard briefly saw a vision of the future, the shape of a serpent devouring the world. A vision of the future. This reminds me a lot of a description from Dark Souls 3, where another god-devouring being called Aldrich also saw a vision of the future, except where Rykard foresaw a serpent devouring the world, Aldrich foresaw the coming age of the deep sea. The question is, can we trust either of these visions as legitimate visions of the future? Or are they more like visions of what may or may not come to pass? It's hard to say, but given enough time in these universes, I suppose it's impossible to rule out that these things would never happen. Also, both of these visions are worded ambiguously enough that even if Rykard or Aldrich were to die, their visions could still come to pass. In Rykard's case, after all, a serpent never dies. To Rykard's knights, this blasphemy with the serpent was one step too far. ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign. But they were reduced to gluttonous depravity once he gave himself to the serpent. Whatever that thing is, it is no longer Praetor Rykard. Someone must kill him, despair him and his ambitions from further dishonour. This is the armour of the Gelmeer Knights. It bears an emblem that none wear any longer, it does for a lord that fell from loft ambition into gluttonous depravity. Indeed, there are no living Gelmeer Knights left in game. And as the Lord lost his dignity, so too did these knights lose their master. This is the Serpent Hunter, a weapon that serves as both greatsword and spear. Thought to have been used to hunt an immortal great serpent in the distant past, it manifests a long blade of light when facing such a creature. When their master's heroic aspirations degenerated into mere greed, his men searched for a weapon with which they might halt their lord. The fact this weapon exists obviously suggests the Great Serpent had enemies that wanted to kill it in the past. I guess sacrificing everything around you might do that. Curiously, the weapon uses a type of white light power that I don't think manifests anywhere else in Elden Ring, and I wish we knew more about whatever enemy of the Great Serpent created this weapon long ago. Regardless, this was the perfect weapon for the Gelmeer Knights to find, so they heroically tried to use it against Raikard, and failed. In a way, these knights were still loyal to Raikard, or the memory of him at least. They wanted to kill Raikard to spare him and his ambitions from dishonour, but Raikard was simply remaining loyal to his ideals, even if he had to abandon his dignity to go down this path. The serpent takes, bolstering itself with the strength of others, and to Raikard, this was just an extension of his current practice, as taking by force became the rule when he had turned to heresy long ago. He believed the gods were no different, and there might be more truth to that than we know. Look at the Erd tree, assimilating the dead to feed itself, for example. Or look at Godric using an ancient ritual of grafting to bolster his own strength. All things can be conjoined indeed. But while Raikard kept his will and remained loyal to his ideals, his forces signed up to usurp the order, not really to become worse than it, and so Raikard lost the favour with the majority of his forces. But speaking of his forces, the marionettes actually weren't the only automatons who fought on, incapable of death or despair. Raikard also had the Iron Virgins. Also known as Abductor Virgins, these undying iron monstrosities have a lot going on with their designs. For one, they each cradle a baby, which is some fascinating symbolism that I hope might be explained in the DLC, but it's what's on the inside that counts here, and I'm not talking about the strips of meat on the inside, which keep their victims nice and cosy, I'm talking about the snakes. If you look closely inside these creatures, you'll realise that the snakes are actually wrapped around a sort of central mechanism. Thus, I think these abductors are likely piloted by snakes. The insides and the snakes even take extra damage when hit, which is a bit more evidence for the snakes being the most important part of the machine. The fact that snakes appear here seems to suggest that these machines were created after the Shattering, and after Raikard took on the Serpent as his aspect, so that's why I only mention these at this latter point in the video. as I'm trying to present things in order with the timeline, and I think these entities showed up later in that timeline. Clearly, Reikard was still keeping up his habit of abducting people, and now it was the snakes who fulfilled that role, spiriting their victims away, not unlike the snakes of Dark Souls and Sekiro. Interestingly, the texture of these snakes is quite metallic, almost as if they're inorganic, animated creatures. And when it comes to snakes having a metallic appearance, there actually is quite a lot of precedence for that phenomenon in Elden Ring. The Coil Shield, for example, is a bronze snake that becomes animated, to the point where it's able to bite and still inflict poison upon enemies. The Gravekeepers, wear armbands that are embellished with bronze snakes, and there are some Gravekeepers whose bronze snakes briefly actually come to life in a grab attack. So yeah, there's definitely something going on with bronze snakes in particular. Incidentally, these Gravekeepers have lore that explains that the snake has become a hated symbol in the Lands Between. The Gravekeepers were actually once gladiators who were driven from the Colosseum, and their cloak reads, the snake is viewed as a traitor to the Urd Tree, and the audience delighted in seeing these bronze effigies beaten and battered in gladiatorial combat. Now, at first you'd think that the snake is viewed as a traitor to the Urd Tree, thanks to Reikard. However, I'm not too sure if that works with the timeline of Elden Ring. Reikard was only consumed by the serpent after the Shattering, and the arenas where the gladiators would have fought were used primarily in the age of Lord Godfrey, and the practice was said to have died out by the age of King Consort Radagon. So, if audiences were delighting in seeing the symbol of a snake being beaten and battered, you'd think that would have occurred in Godfrey's age then, which was long before Reikard, therefore the snake must have already had an ill reputation in the Lands Between. This is where Mesmer comes in. So, the DLC is not yet out as of the making of this video, but the recent trailer seems to suggest that Mesmer and his serpentine aspect has existed from very early on in the timeline. And since Mesmer, as a character, has clearly done something worthy of being sealed away in the Land of Shadow, I wonder what could he have done? Did he assault the Urd Tree, perhaps? Did this event have anything to do with the Great Serpent, or even the serpent slaying greatsword, maybe? Could it have something to do with the Giant's Forge, which has snakes on its design, and a fire that can burn down the Urd Tree? Or could Mesmer have once attempted to burn down the Urd Tree with his own flames? So many questions, and I think we should all go into the DLC looking for answers to questions like these. At any rate, the Abductor Virgins certainly aren't doing the snake's reputation any favours in this modern age. Their iconic weapon is this, the same wheel as Inquisitor Giza's signature weapon, which was adopted for use by the Iron Virgins. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Giza invented them. Our only other source of information on the Abductors comes from Patches. The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels, but long ago they were endowed with a spell of transposition. And get this, a surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big water wheel in the Academy of Rhea Lucaria, its transpositional powers fully intact. So right, if you get caught in it on purpose, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Urd Tree. Or so I'm told. This explains why this Abductor in particular is still capable of transporting you while the others can't. Their abduction powers are a spell. It might have even been Rykard who cast it. You'd think a son of Rinala would be capable of casting an enchantment that could last all this time. This one intact Abduction spell takes victims to a subterranean Inquisition chamber, where they could be interrogated. Rykard's Abductions clearly adapted to include these war machines. Obviously, after making an enemy of Leyndell, he couldn't just invite nobles to the Volcano Manor for interrogation anymore. The world has become hostile to him now, and for a time after the Shattering, I imagine these machines were probably a very important way of getting intel about the state of the world from widely across the Lands Between. These machines are found widely across the Lands Between. They're endlessly fighting, and endlessly attempting to abduct, even though their teleportation enchantments are long faded away. There's a couple of interesting machines. One in Gelmir is missing a head, and has a more wild attack pattern. It's become a part of a demi-human ambush here. Maybe they beheaded it so they could better use it to their advantage? That same sort of thing seems to have happened to this one, in the Altus Plateau as well, which is stuck at the bottom of a cave. Here, the Volga Militia have weaponised it, and it's clearly defeated many intruders within this death pit. Incidentally, that's also what's happened to the one in Raya Lucaria. It can't get out of this hole, and apparently that's the best way to deal with these machines. When you explore the subterranean interrogation chamber that this abductor takes you to, you realise that no torturers are left here. The need for that seems to have long faded, along with the teleportation spells on the abductors. Somewhat ironically, these days it seems that the Albinorics, now driven to insanity, have become the only remaining line of defence in this place. Some even still wear the Black Dumpling, which is a mask forced on a victim's head to lend torture an extra degree of cruelty. It magnifies one's fears, and makes them acutely aware of all forms of pain. I'm not sure why Rikard was so keen to torture Albinorics, but everyone hates Albinorics in the Lands Between, so I guess Rikard was no different. Indeed, torture with the Black Dumpling wasn't done to get intel. To quote the item, when the Black Dumpling goes on, the torturer no longer seeks answers, only to inflict suffering without hope of relief. And so we arrive at the state of the Volcano Manor as it stands when our character explores it long after the Shattering. It's now a place crawling with grotesque creatures, and chief among them are the Manserpents. As the name implies, the Manserpents were born of man and serpent. But what human would copulate with another species? At first glance, you might think that they might have been born of a union between Tanith and Rikard. Rikard had become one with the snake at this late point in our timeline, and Tanith was utterly devoid of life. However, as the name implies, the Manserpents were born and Tanith was utterly devoted to him, to the point where Rikard actually offered Tanith a tonic of forgetfulness to wipe her memories of him, but she refused, saying, My lord, there could be no greater distress than to forget you. So Rikard clearly cared enough about her wellbeing, to the point where he wanted her to forget what he had become, and Tanith was so charmed by him that she refused. However, despite this dedication to each other, Tanith would not become the mother of the Manserpents. Maybe that was another trauma that Rikard did not want to subject her to. I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail. Our lord must have known this all along. Hmph. My meekness is all too clear. Let's learn more about Tanith. We've learned from the Consort's robe that Rikard met Tanith when she was working as a dancer in a foreign land. We learn more about her talents from her dancer's castanets, which are these small instruments that some dancers clap together in their hands as they perform. Tanith's reveal that her passionate dance comprises no seductiveness, but merely a dignified beauty. And I think they're making a point of Tanith's lack of seductiveness for a reason. After her meeting with Rikard, she became his consort, yes, but I don't think that Rikard wanted to have children with her. Lady Tanith is my mother. I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king. That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. The origins of the Manserpents are explored more deeply when we meet Raya, who is a scout for the Volcano Manor who quickly reveals herself as Zorias, a Manserpent who is starting to question her birthright. In the end, Zorias comes to the conclusion that she was not born by the grace of a great king. Rather, she was born in some repellent birthing ritual. And what's more, the Lady Tanith isn't her true mother. Funny, isn't it? I am certain of it. I was born inside this. It's a part of my birth, mother. The truth of Zorias' birth is revealed by the Serpent's Amnion, which reads, Amnion from the mother's womb, which cradled the poor unwanted offspring of a repellent birthing ritual. It will never dry out, remaining damp indefinitely. Truth is, Zorias' birth mother is almost certainly this terrible woman named Daedica. We can surmise this because of the talisman that Zorias leaves behind at the end of the questline. Its description reads, Disturbing likeness of a woman whose skin was flayed. She smiles with a serene tenderness, increases damage taken. It is said that this woman, named Daedica, indulged in every form of adultery and wicked pleasure imaginable, giving birth to a myriad of grotesque children. According to our translator, Loki, the Japanese word for grotesque used here is actually the same one the game uses to describe the deformed man-serpents in English. The clear implication being that this woman consented to what the Serpent's Amnion calls a repellent birthing ritual with a serpent, giving birth to the man-serpents. The serpent she consorted with was almost certainly Rykard himself. I suggest this because in the 1.0 version of the Daedica talisman, Daedica was actually a soft-featured man who was one of Captain Rykard's paramours. It seems this description was eventually changed so that Daedica's character could support the lore of them giving birth to the man-serpents. Therefore, they needed to be a woman. However, I imagine the part where Daedica was one of Rykard's lovers could conceivably still be intact. Therefore, I think it's likely Rykard is the father of the man-serpents. Not to mention, the man-serpent spirit ashes more explicitly state that long ago, the Elder Serpent that dwelled on Mount Gelmir devoured a demigod, and then the birth of the man-serpents followed. Also, the similar naming convention that Rhaia and Rykard share is another piece of evidence. And finally, the Serpent Amnion Rhaia was born from says it cradled the poor unwanted offspring. I'm told the Japanese word for unwanted could perhaps more accurately be stating that Rhaia is a noble's bastard child, which she kind of is if Rykard is her father since Tanith is not her birth mother. So it is that the man-serpents actually might not have been completely unwanted at all. An older version of the Serpent's Amnion states that there are some man-serpents with particularly intelligent offspring. And while this is cut content, it's obviously still true, not just because of Rhaia, but because of this guy. This bloat-headed man-serpent is presented as if they're royalty, with a lavish cloak, jeweled chest, and large throne of their own. They stand here, surrounded by human remains, and they're in a position of dominance over the surviving human nobles who are at the foot of the steps as well. These nobles are tormented by what is likely the Serpent's poison. Clearly, man is no longer valued in this place, and the man-serpents now rule in their stead. Indeed, the man-serpents are actually closest to the way gate that takes you, to Rhaicard, suggesting that they might speak on his behalf somewhat. Speaking of which, it makes sense that a carrion, a former one at least, like Rhaicard, would have a way gate in their domain, but I'm getting off topic. The bloat-head serpent itself casts some very advanced glintstone magics, and the Gelmir glintstone staff they wield talks about how the man-serpents draw from faith, in addition to intelligence, to enhance the potency of their sorcery. Their faith, I assume, would likely be directed at the serpent god, which once had a religion of its own, after all, and the man-serpent's intelligence that they use to cast spells would make sense as well, considering the carrion influence, and maybe even heritage, that they have thanks to Rhaicard. The staff itself even makes a lot of sense for a man-serpent to wield, as it has red glintstone at the tip as the catalyst, and red glintstone is specifically formed from the blood of sacrifices, and the serpents once had a culture of sacrifice as well. In addition to this man-serpent's mastery of sorcery, the man-serpents in general seem to have learned how to fashion weapons and shields, like the copper round shield for example, which has been tempered in lava, and then there's also the magma blade, which was fashioned from actual lava, and is considered impossible for a human to have made. Clearly these serpents have an affinity with magma, and according to the sorcery Gelmir's Fury, the arrogance of attempting to harness the fury of the volcano belongs to men and serpents alone. Speaking of serpents also, there are a few magma worms in Mount Gelmir, and they're at home here in the lava of the volcano. Magma worms are explicitly former heroes who aspired to become dragons, but turned into worms instead, and their lore actually doesn't relate too much to Mount Gelmir. However, I think their lore could still be a nod towards serpents being lesser dragons. Again, serpents being lesser dragons is a FromSoftware staple at this point. Within the volcano manor, we also see serpent statues, many with wings, which could be a reference to their once heavenly draconic origins. But hopefully Mesmer and his draconic eye and his wings and snakes elaborate on this point in the DLC, since I feel like there's some ancient history we're missing. Speaking of ancient history, one of the biggest mysteries in all of Mount Gelmir is this place, the Temple of Iglae. This place is where we loot the Serpent's Amnion, that product of a birthing ritual that Raya recognises and was born from. This item is overshadowed by this, the flayed skin and head of a serpent, which I would assume might be Iglae, who the temple is named after, though that's just speculation. Another piece of speculation is that this large serpent's skin is flayed in the first place, though I think that might be explained by.. by the presence of the Godskin Noble, who defends it. To sum up the Godskins' lore briefly, the Godskin Nobles once served a character called the Glomite Queen, who was clearly a character who was a proponent of bringing death to the gods. And what's interesting about the Glomite Queen is that there's some dialogue from Melana that suggests that the Glomite Queen doesn't just care about death, but births as well. And so, what if the Serpent's Amnion, this product of new birth, might actually be what's being defended by the Godskin here? Or maybe the Godskin wants to bring death to the Serpent God. Maybe this Godskin, like so many other Godskins in-game, is allied with blasphemous forces in order to strike back at Queen Marika. Or maybe the Godskins have ties to the Snake, since their necks can do this extendy thing. Maybe they were involved with the Man-Serpent birthing ritual. Maybe we just have no idea, because you can speculate in a ton of different directions when it comes to this place. So, I'm gonna stop myself here until we have the DLC, just in case that brings some new information to light. I'm also going to hold off on discussing the recusants of Volcano Manor in this video, as we'd love to cover them in a more cinematic Prepare to Cry episode. And I don't really like treading the same ground twice on my channel, if I can avoid it. And if you're interested in supporting my videos and seeing that Prepare to Cry video early, as well as many other videos, check out my Patreon. We have some new Patreon merch, we've got these new Seekers t-shirts, as well as some new artwork that you can get if you subscribe to the Patreon exclusively. So, check that out if you want to support, but also get something in return. I probably don't talk about that enough. For now, though, I'll end this video on the truth of the Volcano Manor in the current age, which is this. It's to here that Tarnished are invited, so that they might join the ranks of the recusants and prove themselves as a champion. They fight against their fellow Tarnished, who are commonly seen as followers of Grace, and therefore are the enemy. And a recusant's final reward is a meeting with Lord Reikard, who wishes now to consume the greatest champions left in the world, so that they might all become one with him and his blasphemy. Oh, you... Allow me some time. Our Lord's carcass is vast and not easily consumed. Dear Reikard, please, find purchase within me. I wish to be your serpent, your family. One day, let us devour the gods together. Let us devour the gods together. One day, we'll do a proper Prepare to Cry episode on these characters. But for now, thank you to everyone who helped in the filming and preparation of this video, and I'll see you next time.\n",

      "[Doc 14: Lore Revelations in the Shadow of the Erdtree]\n",
      "I'm willing to bet that as soon as you entered this place, you knew that we were going to get some answers in the Shadow of the Ood Tree. And we have. There are satisfying revelations regarding Queen Marika, and Michaela, and the omen, and dragons, and the gods. We even now know what Melania whispered to Radan in this scene, before her scarlet flower bloomed in Caelid. This video will only scratch the surface. It's just an overview, a teaser of new revelations, and the foreshadowing of a deeper analysis to come. So, let's get into it, and this time, let's begin at the end. After you defeat the final boss, promised consort Radan, on your 400th attempt, you can read the remembrance of a god and a lord, which states, in their childhood, Michaela saw in Radan a lord. His strength, and his kindness, that stood in stark contrast with their afflicted selves. The cutscene that plays here is a memory. And so, Michaela made his heartfelt wish, that Radan would one day be his king. Now, this ending, and the reappearance of Radan, has received a lot of early criticism, but I think this encounter goes a lot deeper than some people are giving it credit for. For example, we're hearing about Michaela's side of the vow in this scene, and about what Michaela wants, but what about Radan? What was his part of the vow? What did he want? There is evidence of Radan being kind, sure, but this is also a man who celebrates war. Did he truly share Michaela's vision for an age of compassion? And if he wanted to be with Michaela, why did he fight so vehemently against his death in the lands between, that would have brought his soul to the realm of shadow with Michaela? But the most chilling thing about this story, I think, is that even if Radan did want to become Michaela's lord, and I can see that side of the argument too, to be fair, but even if he did want that, do Radan's wants even matter in the face of Michaela the kind? As we speculated long ago, from items like the Bewitching Branch, Michaela has the power of enchantment over others. He has the power to steal hearts. Literally, if you are embraced by him twice in the final fight, your heart is stolen, and it's like a part of you dies. This effect can also be seen in Michaela's faithful band, who overcome their differences and shortcomings to fight for Michaela's cause, until Michaela's enchantment is broken, and they turn at each other's throats. And what makes Michaela a fascinating character is that he isn't manipulating others for selfish reasons. His cause actually is righteous. When he wields love as a weapon, he does it genuinely to make the world a better place, without any intent to cause harm. However, such acts are still oppressive. If your want is taken away, what is left of you that remains? Perhaps the saddest example of this is Moog, who, as we speculated, was indeed under Michaela's spell. In the specimen storehouse, you can find the Secret Rite Scroll, which details the secret rite by which Michaela will ascend to godhood. It reads, A lord will usher in a god's return, and the lord's soul will require a vessel. Hansbach reveals Michaela's plans in full. In your fight with Redan, you might have noticed the horns sprouting from his gauntlets, and his tendency to perform bloodflame attacks. This is because Redan occupies Moog's body, fulfilling the terms of the secret rite at the Gate of Divinity, where Michaela will become a god. In retrospect, Moog was under Michaela's spell all along, and became obsessed with Michaela, believing they would ascend together as lord and god. But Michaela had plans for Moog, not just as a corpse to pull into the Realm of Shadow as a vessel for Redan's soul, but as Hansbach reveals, Moog was also used as a means for Michaela to enter the Realm of Shadow in the first place. A while back, I speculated that the Realm of Shadow was a sort of death dimension, and that Michaela's sacrilegious death at the hands of Moog might have been intentional so that Michaela could enter the Realm of Shadow, and actually, surprisingly, those speculations were proven correct as well. Hansbach confirms that Moog enabled Michaela to enter, and the Tower of Suppression makes it clear that all manners of death wash up in the Realm of Shadow, which lies at the very centre of the Lands Between. Incidentally, Redan's return also answers one of the biggest mysteries of Elden Ring, which was what Melania whispered to Redan as she let the Rotflower blossom at the end of their fight. According to the Young Lion's Helm, she whispered, \"...Michaela awaits thee, her promised consort.\" And so, Melania's southward march to Caelod is finally explained as well. She was there to kill Redan, so that his soul could be taken to the Realm of Shadow, and the vow could be upheld, at any cost. Once transported to the Realm of Shadow, Michaela set off for the Tower, and as his great rune says, on the way he abandoned everything. His golden flesh, his blinding strength, even his fate. All in this attempt to bury the original sin, to embrace the whole of it and be reborn as a new god. \"...Michaela has said as much himself. He wishes now to throw it all away. He says the act, though undoubtedly painful, will sear clean the Erd Tree's wanton sin. The truth of his claim can be found at each cross. It is evidence enough to earn my belief.\" But what was the Erd Tree's sin, that Michaela died and was reborn for? Well, now we've talked about the end, this brings us to the beginning. \"...Michaela the kind spoke of the beginning. The seduction, and the betrayal. An affair from which gold arose. And so too was Shadow born.\" These words come from Ledda, and while she never says them in game, they're pretty damn important, because with Marika in the footage, it's clear that this was her seduction, and her betrayal, that was the affair from which gold arose, and Shadow was born. The same music that played in that moment also plays here, in the village where it all began. The Shaman Village, to the northeast. At its center is this, a minor Erd Tree, an incantation which reveals that this was Marika's home, which she one day bathed in gold. So Marika's home was a Shaman Village, the implication clearly being that she herself was a Shaman. This was likely a matriarchal society of other Numen women, though that's perhaps speculation better left for another video. Put simply though, a Shaman is defined as someone who has influence in matters of the spirit. Their spirituality is what's valued here, and it's on this point that this story takes a bit of a dark turn, for the message at the hidden entrance actually reads, have mercy for the spirited away Shamans. Adjacent to this message is the statue that moves aside at the sign of the Oh Mother gesture in Mesmas Shadowkeep. This emote is a clue to the truth, and it actually leads us all the way down here to where the Oh Mother gesture can be found. This dire place is called Bonney Village, and a phantom at the Whipping Hut elaborates on just who the Shamans were, or rather, the value they had. He states, for pity's sake, your place is in the jar, nice sainthood itself awaits you within. For Shamans like you, this is your lot. Life were you accorded for this alone. So the Shamans, in the words of their abusers at least, were accorded life for a singular purpose, and that was to be stuffed inside of jars with others. A nearby whip, bestrewn with rotting, misshapen teeth, elaborates on how and why it was used on the Shamans. For one, it states that the pain it inflicts was used to encourage their obedience. But additionally, it says that as their wounds ripen, they grow inflamed and ooze pus, and the flesh of Shamans was said to meld harmoniously with others. So it is that the Shamans stuffed into jars become this living amalgam of beings, presumably with the Flayed Shaman herself at the fore. So now we know what happened to the Shamans. They were whipped into submission, and forced inside of jars. We know a little bit of the why as well. Apparently it was done so they could become Saints. But the next question I want to answer is who. Who did this to them? It was the Hornsent. The caterpillar mask, worn by Hornsent himself, reveals that it was a ritual implement of the greater potentates of Bonney Village, which is this very village where we just discussed the evidence of the Shamans' abuse. It goes on to state that the mask was used to ward off thoughts of impurity, doubt, temptation and other wickednesses one is vulnerable to while absorbed in divine ritual. And man, if you need to ward off thoughts of doubt and wickedness while you're stuffing Flayed people inside of jars, maybe what you're doing is just straight up wrong. I'm starting to understand why Marika purged the Realm of Shadow with fire. It's as Leta says. But if this mask wasn't proof enough of the Hornsent being responsible, look at Bellerat Jail. It's below Bellerat itself, which was the settlement of the Hornsent, and to this day the Innards and the Shamans remain, with the Shamans offering their prayers to the Innards of the Great Jars such that they might be reborn one day into Sainthood. But what is Sainthood? Well, it's never explained directly. I do have some ideas, but they might have to wait for another video. What we do know is that the Hornsent were obsessed with invoking divinity, and forcing the Shamans to achieve Sainthood was likely one facet of that. So it's the Hornsent that we need to discuss next. The Hornsent are an extremely ritualistic people, with swathes of their culture devoted to spiritual research and invoking the divine. One of the most sacred things to them is the Crucible, which they have to thank for their tangled horns, which are considered an evolutionary gift. If you didn't know, the Crucible has been long established as this primordial form of the Ood Tree, a blending of life that became the Ood Tree's primal vital energies, and apparently it originated in the place that became the Realm of Shadow. This becomes quite clear thanks to Devonia, who is the longest serving of the Crucible Knights. According to her helmet, she quested in search of the Crucible's origin, and departed from the lands of the Ood Tree alone. Another item we can find that's a clue for the Crucible is Spira, an incantation for a Spiral of Light. The Spiral, it says, is a normalised Crucible current that, one day, will form a column that stretches to the gods. Maybe it's no coincidence that the White Tower of Belerath is a spiral, nor that it culminates in a divine gateway that is a column of the dead, stretching to the gods. There's also trees that include the dead, but I digress, I'm getting off topic. Back to Marika, because at some point, it seems, Marika rose to prominence within, or adjacent to, this Hornsent culture. We can kind of infer this because Hornsent refer to Marika's eventual purge as a betrayal, and something can only really be a betrayal if you were aligned with them in the first place, right? So, the Hornsent were aware of Marika, and likely her Ood Tree as well, before what they call the betrayal. But how? How did Marika rise to such power in their homeland, where she was presumably a shaman, one of those subjugated? Well, before there was this betrayal, there was a seduction, from which gold arose, and I think the Fingers had a hand in it. Ymir is the High Priest of Manus Meta, a cathedral of the Hand, to the east. Once he instructed Rolana herself in the sorceress arts, but eventually he would come to abandon this allegiance to the moon, stating that the moon was merely the closest of the celestial bodies, and nothing more. I am a glintstone sorcerer. We study the stars, and examine the life therein. Are you familiar with our findings? Long ago, we began as stardust, born of a great rupture far across the skies. We too are children of the greater will. Is that not divine? Is that not sublime? And yet, none can fathom its implications, its utter brilliance. In the ruins of this land, and beneath Manus Meta itself, are the echoes of that greater truth that Ymir glimpsed. This is Meta herself, the Mother of Fingers. Her remembrance reads, the mother of all two fingers, and finger-creepers, was in turn a magnificently gleaming daughter of the greater will, and the first shooting star to fall upon the lands between. You might recall the Elden Ring. and the Elden Beast made landfall in the lands between upon a star as well. But Meta came even before that. So it was that this mother birthed the fingers, communing with and receiving signs from the Greater Will, who occupied the great beyond. But at some point, Meta became broken, abandoned, and no sign has come through ever since. Do you recall what I said? That Marika and the fingers that guided her were unsound from the start? Well, the truth lies deeper still. It is their mother who is damaged and unhinged. The fingers are but unripe children, victims in their own right. It's not clear when Meta was broken, abandoned, but I assume it was before Marika started taking the guidance of the fingers, since Ymir states that the fingers were unsound from the start. Thus, the Greater Will's guidance is outdated at the very least, and has been for all of Marika's reign. That's a pretty big revelation. Incidentally, Placidusax was also Elden Lord before Marika, and he was abandoned by his god as well. So maybe things became broken around that time? Lots of speculation to be had there. At any rate, abandonment by the Greater Will, or no, Marika took up the power of the Elden Ring that the fingers offered for her own reasons, and the abandoned fingers spread the glory of the Greater Will through her, and she through them. Another important item on this topic is the ancient seed talismans that can be found, which depicts the two fingers around an Erd tree seed. They had a hand in the birth of the Erd tree. All this while, the fingers claimed to be envoys for the Greater Will, but that's a lie. The Greater Will is gone. The fingers are alone, operating on outdated guidance. This is something that many characters suspected, but most characters in Elden Ring assumed that this happened around the time the Elden Ring was shattered. It's a revelation that the fingers have been broken for a really long time, and so the Tarnished, too, is alone, following this guidance of grace that now likely only belongs to Marika herself, if anyone. And Marika might have played friendly with the Hornscent for a time, but eventually she had what was surely vengeance when the Hornscent were purged, subjugated, and betrayed. The Realm of Shadow became this disconnected domain of death, and the Shadow Tree that looms high became the realm's symbol of abandonment, not grace. Before she left, Marika bathed the village of her home in gold, placing a small illusory tree that restores the health of those nearby. She did this knowing full well that there was no one left to heal. Then she left, never to return. Not even for her son, who she left behind to endlessly enact her subjugation of the Realm of Shadow. So next, let's talk about Mesmer, the Impaler. As anticipated, Mesmer is entirely loyal to his mother, who is Queen Marika. His armor reveals that on his mother's wishes, Mesmer made himself a symbol of fear, undertaking the Cleansing Crusade she desired, and in the end, all those stripped of the grace of gold would perish in the embrace of Mesmer's flame. To this end, he had his Black Knights, Fire Knights, and Common Infantry, not to mention the Carian forces who followed Rolana into war on Mesmer's behalf. So it was that the Hornscent were purged in a war without end. A phantom at Castle Ensis bemoans, Oh Marika, I beg embrace your child and give us a sign. How long must this holy war stretch on? But Marika never returned, testing their faith. One phantom even raises the possibility that Mesmer himself has been abandoned. He has. The final straw for him is when you, a Tarnished who would become Elden Lord, arrives at his doorstep. I will not suffer. A lord devoid of light. Oh mother, forgive me. Soon, Tarnished. Wilt thou be taken in the jaws of the Abyssal Serpent, Shorn of Light? Like his siblings, Mesmer was born cursed. In fact, the game likens his curse to Melanus, who is heavily implied to be his younger sister. Mesmer, too, it is said, bore a vision of fire. We learn this from the item Mesmer's Kindling, which describes the fire that endlessly burns within him. A dark thing, eaten away at by a wicked serpent. His remembrance elaborates on this serpent, stating a malevolent snake writhed within Mesmer, and so his very mother plucked out his eye and put in its place a seal of grace. So, I was wrong about this eye. It wasn't the slitted eye of dragon communion. Instead, it was Marika's seal of grace, holding back something terrible. The description continues to state that even with this seal in place, Marika's fear compelled her to secret away her child within the realm of shadow, hidden away, keeping company with the original sin, and a hatred that would not be confined. There's so much more to say about this base serpent and the dark fire. There's so much more to say about Mesmer. We even learn from Gaius's remembrance that Mesmer was an older brother to Redan, meaning Mesmer's birth, and thus the birth of Melana as well, likely would have arrived much earlier in the timeline, and there's a ton of curiosities with Mesmer's knights as well, some of whom were loyal, some who were disloyal, and some of whom occupied this space of reluctance in between. But those stories are better off in other videos. In the interest of moving on, there is one last thing I want to talk about with Mesmer, and it's that in the cut dialogue, Mesmer notes that Michaela has spoken of us to him, and indeed, we do know that Michaela did come through this shadow keep, divesting himself at the crosses all the while, which brings us to our next topic, Saint Trina. Each cross of Michaela is a piece of himself marked with his great rune, arms, an eye, flesh, but there's a couple of crosses in particular that I remember as a part of what was an extremely chilling moment. As you progress along the coast towards the fissure, you notice that Michaela has divested himself of his doubt and vacillation. Without these things, he was free, it seems, to abandon something that was very dear to him, and inside the fissure, at what is perhaps the deepest part of the land in the realm of shadow, we realize that Michaela has actually divested himself of his love. A phantom says, Kindly Michaela, I see you've thrown away something you should not have under any circumstances. How will you salvation offer to those who cannot be saved? When you could not even save your other self? His other self, his love, his fate, was Saint Trina. So to Michaela, who was one of Marika's kin, having a second self is nothing new, really. We've now even learned from the shamans that their flesh melds harmoniously with others, after all. Actually, the fact that Saint Trina was able to be discarded might even suggest that Radagon could have become divested from Marika in a similar way. But Michaela's other half was truly special, and she was renowned for granting peaceful sleep to many in the lands between, which I imagine would have been very much appreciated in this land that's filled with the weary undead. So, Saint Trina naturally had many followers, and perhaps at the fore was Teolier, whose obsession with Saint Trina returns almost immediately when Michaela's enchantment finally breaks. I'm feeling rather lost, haunted by memories of Saint Trina. Her visage, her scent, the lure of velvety sleep. What kindly Michaela chastened me for falling for Saint Trina, while knowing that she was the discarded half. The problem is, I simply cannot help it. I would sacrifice everything just to gaze upon her one last time. Saint Trina is below, defended by a putrescent knight, who is basically tainted flesh once given eternal rest, that now serves Saint Trina. Die enough times to Saint Trina's nectar, and you will hear her words. All of this makes you realize that if Godhood really would be Michaela's cage, as Saint Trina believes, then it really might have been Marika's cage as well. It echoes what the Sorceals suggested long ago, that solemn duty weighs upon the One Beholden, not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance. In the end, Marika's caged divinity is likely a part of why she shattered the Elden Ring. And so, Michaela's divinity would surely come at a cost to him. He would essentially be sacrificing himself to bring about that gentle age in the name of everybody who would fall under his enchantment. And this enchantment is a tendency that Michaela regains when he returns in full force as a god, because once charmed by Michaela, a circlet of light adorns your head. And according to the description of the circlet of light, which you receive after Michaela's defeat, this enchanting circlet would have been the foundation of Michaela's age of compassion, not the Elden Ring. Presumably, in his age, all would be charmed, but Michaela found one that would refuse to be embraced, you. No wonder, as one god and one king consort is all the world needs, and you're the chosen Elden Lord of a different age, whatever ending that may be for you. So naturally, you would have refused to be embraced. Thank you for watching, and thank you for listening to me, even with my nasally covert voice. Sorry about that.

It was still tough. Honestly, the most fascinating content is yet to come. I still want to talk about how Bael, the new dragon in the DLC, is actually the father of the Drakes, and how he had a war with Placidusax.

      "[Doc 15: The Lore of Elden Ring is Insane]\n",
      "Midras Sanctum..a veritable paradise..and then.. What happened here? The map for this place now refers to it as an abyss, a place mired in frenzy, forbidden by the Hornscent. Interestingly, the word the Japanese use to describe this place is Naraka, which essentially is the Buddhist hell. They're describing this place as a world of great suffering, torture, and torment. But before this, it was a sanctum, a private hideaway for the sage Midra and other Hornscent who resided here. Midra himself has no visible horns, yet I'd still consider him to be one of the Hornscent's brethren. After all, many of his fellows have horns. His manse was built with spiral pillars, and spirals are an important symbol to the Hornscent. He presumably observed Hornscent customs at the church in the sanctum, which itself bears divine beast iconography. That said, the church is about as far away from Midra's manse as can be in this place. So perhaps religion wasn't so important to those in the sanctum, geographically isolated as they were from the rest of the realm. Indeed, in contrast to the deep spirituality we witness in other Hornscent domains, I'd argue that Midra's manse was uniquely a place of discussion and learning. For example, countless books once adorned these bookshelves, and as per this sight of grace, the manse once had a discussion hall where knowledge could have been shared. Not to mention, Midra is renowned as a Great Sage, a title that could only belong to a man who was profoundly wise. But when we arrive at the manse, most books aren't on their shelves. Instead, in most cases, they're in piles, and have been burned, seemingly deliberately. So who did this? If I had to guess, I think it might have been the Hornscent Inquisitors. As we'll get into later, the Hornscent Inquisitors were a powerful force that invaded Midra's sanctum, to stamp out the frenzy that had taken root here, and they do carry live flames which enable their fire breath attacks. So if books were being intentionally burned in this place of learning, then maybe it was for a reason. Maybe Midra and this remote sect of curious Hornscent discovered something they shouldn't have. Maybe they discovered the knowledge that led to frenzy. But is there an overlap between frenzy and knowledge in Elden Ring? Well, let me try and argue that there is, using Bloodborne as an analogue. Frenzy in Elden Ring is largely synonymous with frenzy in Bloodborne. The systems share a name, status mechanics, and both games now even have frenzy-inducing enemies called Winter Lanterns. In terms of lore though, they're a little bit different. In Bloodborne, frenzy is the symptom that afflicts those who acquire incomprehensible knowledge or insight about the world, sending them mad as a result. Whereas in Elden Ring, frenzy more commonly crops up in those who experience severe suffering and despair, and with their eyes aflame, they share that frenzy with others. That said, I still think that that suffering and despair in Elden Ring does reveal a somewhat eldritch truth about the world. Namely, that suffering and despair are this intrinsic part of the world's order on a cosmic level. Look at Marika's Minor Ode Tree that she left behind in her village, for example. It is only the kindness of gold, without order, which, like many other things, seems to suggest that order cannot exist without suffering and despair. I don't think it's a stretch to think that Midra, and the Hornscent of the Manse, dedicated to learning and discussion, could have stumbled upon such a disturbing truth about the world. Especially since that truth has to do with the three fingers and the two, and there's evidence that the denizens of the Manse were surreptitiously researching the fingers. Behind a portrait of Midra are three odd shapes with orange cloth draped over them, and underneath are fingers. These are the same fingers and stones that can be found in the Finger Ruins, and incidentally, the Finger Ruins of Rhea are adjacent to the Abyss itself. Shoutout to Zlovsky on Twitter, who separated the models so we could get a closer look at these. In the end though, how Frenzy took root in Midra's sanctum is open to speculation. Maybe I'm wrong, and it had nothing to do with their research. Maybe the fingers under these covers were never meant to be discovered by us. Or maybe the Frenzy of Midra's Manse had more to do with the woman in this portrait, who stands over Midra with a curious smile. We'll get into that more later. But first, what is Frenzy? What eldritch truth does it reveal? And what does that have to do with the fingers? To answer that, we're going to have to go back further in Elden Ring's timeline than we ever have on this channel, to the cosmic, metaphysical origins of life. All that there is came from the One Great. Then came fractures, and births, and souls. But the Greater Will made a mistake. Torment, despair, affliction, every sin, every curse. Every one born of the mistake. And so, what was borrowed, must be returned. Melt it all away with the yellow chaos flame, until all is one again. These words were spoken by Hayata, Finger Maiden of the Three Fingers, who divines their words. Let's break these lines down. So, everything, everything in the world of Elden Ring is said to have come from the One Great. The One Great is essentially the beginning, a unified whole. It is the universe condensed as one. But then, a few lines later, Hayata mentions a Greater Will that made a mistake. She doesn't say the One Great made a mistake, she says the Greater Will made a mistake. Almost as if the Greater Will is the One Great. And I think it is, kind of. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that the One Great had a Greater Will. Because if the One Great is a collective, then the Greater Will could have been the dominant part of its intent. Its Greater Will, so to speak. And I'm saying this in the past tense here, because at some point, there was a moment of fracture, a veritable big bang, where the One Great was no more, but the Greater Will remained. This moment is called a Cosmic Rupture in the DLC, by Count Ymir, who says that long ago we began as stardust, born of a great rupture far across the skies. We too are children of the Greater Will. So life had essentially been created. In many worlds, possibly. To give order to its children in the Lands Between, specifically, the Greater Will first sent down Meta, the Mother of the Two Fingers, and then the Elden Ring. While we learn from the remembrance of the Mother of Fingers that Meta was the mother of all Two Fingers and Finger Creepers, it says nothing about her being the mother of the Three Fingers. Thus, I think that when the One Great fractured, the Greater Will, and its desire for order, wasn't the only thing that was created. Frenzy and a desire for chaos was split off entirely. This is a separate part of the One Great that believes fracture was a mistake, and that regression is the only path forward. This frenzied part of the One Great is called an Outer God, as per Michaela's Needle. So as such, like the Greater Will, it also has its envoys, Three Fingers. And the fact that its envoys are Three Fingers is likely no coincidence. Two plus three equals a five fingered hand, and thus, I think, Three Fingers being envoys sends a powerful message. The message being that if order is run by two fingers, then the other three are naturally the ones that are missing. Of course, this is just speculation, but I like to think that the Three Fingers are kind of a revelation in and of themselves. It sends the message that once, all was a part of the One Great. The Three Fingers, and the Two. Unlike the Two Fingers, the Three Fingers are free to tell us their truth. That there was a mistake in the fracturing of things long ago, and that under the branches of order, life now divides and distinguishes, leading to torment, despair, affliction, sins and curses. And so they believe the only solution is to melt everything away with the Yellow Chaos Flame until all is one again. I want to quickly talk about the nature of the One Great, and the Greater Will, because there have been some revelations revealed by Elden Ring's DLC. One of them is that the Greater Will both is, and inhabits, a lightless abyss, as is depicted by the empty space in Count Ymir's headpiece. Now, this is going to sound contradictory, and of course this is all just speculative territory on a cosmic level, but I think, somehow, the birth of everything might have come from a void. The Greater Will's void. Astel, natural born of the void, is one such example of this happening, after all. Because of this bastard of the stars, we know that life can come from a void. So if a void is a clue to the Greater Will's nature, then maybe a void is also what the One Great was, and inhabited. And so, perhaps it's no coincidence then, that when frenzy burns something, it burns it away to nothingness. One Great Void. In the Gravesight Plain, we come across countless spirit gravestones, which are gravestones that have started to turn into spirits. Fitting for a land where all manners of death drift, these stones, if crafted together with a swollen grape, create a surging frenzied flame, an item which violently spits frenzy like butter in a hot pan. Its description reads, spirits are eternal, and yet, frenzied flame melts them away regardless. It's no wonder then, that Torrent, being a spirit, is terrified of this place. Naturally, too, the Hornscent, whose culture revolves around spirits, forbid the flame's use. And, to stamp it out, at some point, they would send an order of inquisitors to invade and purge Midra's Sanctum. Though apparently, the fact frenzy is forbidden hasn't stopped the one who invented this consumable. The Mad Craftsman's cookbook that teaches it reveals that it is a record of crafting techniques, left by a craftsman who served Midra and Ninaya. His eyes were burned by the flame of frenzy. But were his experiments with frenzy being done before, or after, the purge of Midra's Sanctum? What I really want to understand here is, was frenzy brewing in the manse for a while? Or did it only truly become a threat when the Inquisition invaded? Let's talk about that. We know that Frenzy must have been present at the manse in some capacity before the Hornscent Inquisition arrived. Why else would the Inquisition have come to stamp it out? However, I don't think it was out of control, by any means. I think they were merely on the brink of it, and that's because of this tortured phantom of the manse, who questions why the Inquisition and their cruelty was even necessary. While begging for mercy, he says, I ask, what crime did Great Midra commit? It's not clear whether he simply doesn't understand the threat that Frenzy represents, or whether he simply doesn't think Midra is to blame for it. But I think we can at least take from this that Frenzy wasn't out of control at the Sanctum. It was just there, and the Hornscent Inquisitors had been made aware of it. But I reckon even the mere hint of Frenzy would have been the beginning of the end for Midra's Sanctum, and that's because Frenzy is essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of Frenzy and its void inspires an extreme response to those in power, leading to the torture and torment of those who are Frenzied, which is itself an extreme response that exacerbates Frenzy even more, and on and on it goes. In the end, Frenzy only really exists because of how awful the world is, and the torture to stifle it only proves that fact. So when the Inquisition arrived to purge this damnation like no other, they brought pain, as was their way. These Hornscent Inquisitors are not unlike Reikard's own Inquisitors, who we discussed in a recent video. Both forces used torture to extract the answers they seek, and both Inquisitions likely existed to root out traitors and threats to their regime. As opposed to the fire of Reikard's Inquisitors, the Hornscent's brand of Inquisition utilises golden arcs called barbs, which, according to the spell, were a known symbol of coercive questioning. The barbs on the Great Sword of Damnation, for example, unwrap to pierce the victim from within, inflicting continuous wounds to assure eternal agony. There's actually an intriguing bit of lore hidden in the weapons skill of this item, which reads, There is something of the Golden Order in the sight of those fixed upon this crux. The Golden Order. For me, this brings to mind Marika, crucified as she is upon a Golden Arc at the end of the game. Alternatively, since the Golden Order was created upon the removal of destined death, perhaps the Great Sword of Damnation evokes this fact by inflicting eternal suffering without death as a release. Thus is the Golden Order seen in the shape of those fixed upon its crux. Perhaps. It's hard to say for sure what was meant by this line, but I'm glad this line exists because I think it means that they want us to question why the barbs of the Hornscent look like the rune arcs of the Elden Ring. So why? Why do the Hornscent have these golden arcs and methods of torture that echo the Golden Order, when theirs is a civilisation that preceded the Golden Order and the Elden Ring? So to answer that, while I think it's true that the Hornscent were around long before I do think Marika and the Elden Ring became part of their culture for a time. The simplest proof of this is in how the Hornscent believe that Marika betrayed them. Because for them to consider Marika's actions a betrayal, Marika must have been considered a part of the Hornscent's culture on some level. But for more evidence of Marika's involvement in this place at this time, take a look here, where you respawn after getting jumpscared by a Winter Lantern. There's a stake of Marika here, and for these to be in the Realm of Shadow, it means that Marika must have been a force in the world long before the Inquisition arrived, even here in this sanctum that's geographically separated from the rest of the realm. And while you could argue that these are just here for a gameplay reason, and that they have no relevancy to the lore, I don't think so, because I think FromSoftware are aware of the lore implications of these statues. For evidence of this, look at Raya Lucaria. This is a place where Marika would have been unwelcome, and so there are no stakes of Marika at all here. All of this is to say that torture was ingrained in the Golden Order, be it via the Hornscent's Inquisitors, or Rykard's Inquisitors, or the Elden Beast itself. Order requires enforcement, it seems. Remember, Marika's minor oratory has taught us that there is kindness without order, and therefore, that there is cruelty with it. And so, even though such torture exacerbates... baits Frenzy, it was the institutionalised way forward for the Hornsent, who, as we know from other parts of the lore, were a race that definitely had no issues persecuting their own brethren. The tortured phantom we mentioned earlier laments, I beg you stop, haven't I taken enough? Are we not brethren, common in our line? And yet you offer only cruelty. Here in this sanctum, where Frenzy was taking root, the Hornsent brought their full strength to bear. But perhaps the place should have been left alone, for the results of the Inquisition were mixed, to say the least. Clearly, the Inquisition wasn't prepared to handle the answers it found, and many Inquisitors have become frenzied in the Abyssal Woods, revealing new attacks of Frenzy Flame. Interestingly, one spell they channel is Frenzied Burst, which has a description that talks about how every single person who attempted to control the Flame of Frenzy succumbed to madness after a desperate internal struggle. This is the same incantation that Vike uses, and it might be a reflection of his own struggle with madness. The fact that this incantation exists is called a meagre victory over Frenzy, and this is why I think the Inquisitors fought hard before succumbing to the Frenzy. Perhaps this first-hand witnessing of the despair that was coming as a result of their own torture touched them, or perhaps they fell victim to the aging untouchables, the Winter Lanterns, who we'll talk about more later. The forest is now truly the most horrific part of the sanctum, in my opinion, not the manse itself. And I say that because the Inquisitors who occupy the manse are not the Frenzied variant. Despite Frenzy having infected the rats and shadowy horn scent within, the Inquisitors of the manse don't have a single Frenzy Flame attack. Why? Well, I think this was done to show that their Inquisition was successful, to a degree, thanks to the majority of the Inquisition's strength being focused here, at the manse. And there is Inquisition strength here. For example, one of the fat Inquisitors is in possession of Revered Spirit Ash, a powerful blessing of the horn scent, and there are even the spirits of Divine Beast Warriors roaming the halls. The Divine Beast Warriors were an elite force among the horn scent, you know that already from fighting them, don't you? To be clear, though, these aren't physical beast warriors, they're actually spirits. Perhaps these warriors were once part of the Inquisition's forces, and then died in this place. What's more likely, though, I think, is that perhaps their ashes were given to the Inquisitors, who then summoned them here to fight, as weapons to be wielded in their assault. We do, after all, know that the Inquisitors are capable of summoning the spirits of their comrades. We know this thanks to Jori, the Elder Inquisitor, who rings a sort of spirit calling bell to summon his brethren in his boss fight. And it's here, in this place where the catacomb spills out into the forest that he holds down the fort, alone, a final frontier for those coming in or out. According to the Inquisitor ashes, Inquisitions often perplexed the minds of the uninitiated, and so seniority was viewed as an asset, and Jori is an Elder Inquisitor. Thus his age helps to explain why he's the last one remaining on the edge of the forest, endlessly calling in his brethren to fulfil their duties properly in death. One thing I wonder though, is why Inquisitions perplexed the minds of the uninitiated? Was it because these Inquisitions were focused on torture so deeply? Could newer inductees not understand or fathom why they were performing these terrible rites? We do know from the Caterpillar Mask that doubt about the terrible rites they were performing was a thing, and that they had to intentionally ward this away, so perhaps this torture inflicted via the Inquisitions caused a similar sort of doubt. Whatever the case, to an extent, the Hornscent efforts here were successful. The books were burned. The manse was stifled. On that note, I want to talk about the ten figures that abound outside the manse. There's not much information on these guys, I think, but if I had to guess, I'd say that these ten were Midra's associates, who were bound and executed outside the manse. Their somewhat similar garb to Midra's, and also the gold protruding from their necks might be an indication of that. This, plus the fact that they're just facing away from the manse, strikes me as a warning for those in the forest to stay away from the manse, which Midra's executioners have now laid claim to. Speaking of execution, as a result of the Inquisition's invasion, Midra himself accepted the Great Sword of Damnation, and pledged to endure their eternal punishment, warning others to stay away from him lest they succumb. But I don't think this was a true victory for the Inquisitors, because in reality, while Midra endured, the frenzy was ripening within him, and one day, it would be a fruit fit to burst. All according to plan, perhaps. Despite evidence of the Inquisition's victory in this place, Frenzy is entrenched pretty deeply. Now, at least. The very earth is scarred, and even the animals are afflicted. Even the originally multicoloured flowers of this place have changed to be coloured by Frenzy, and one particularly inventive perfumer has clearly used these to create the Frenzy Flame perfume. It's clear that Frenzy is ripening here, and I think most of it came as a result of the Inquisition itself. There's a curious enemy in this place that I think supports this idea. The Madding Hand. It's a human NPC, whose namesake is a weapon. A glove, stitched together from the flayed skin of the victims of a butcherous bloodbath. It was forged of an unyielding black impulse towards revenge, fostered in those who were hunted down as heretics by their own brethren. So, the heretics in this description would have been the Hornsent denizens of the Sanctum, and their brethren who hunted them down would have been the Hornsent Inquisitors. And now, the heretics' desire for revenge has been stitched together into a hand, made of their flayed skin. I was originally going to suggest that the Madding Hand himself skinned these victims to create this glove, but since the Tooth Whip exists, and it was used by the Hornsent, it's possible that the flaying was just a part of the Hornsent torture of these heretics. Either way, this Madding Hand has taken it upon himself to fight on the heretics' frenzied behalf. So who is he? Well, he's actually wearing the Gravebird's black quill armour, which is an item cast in the image of the Gravebird, a gravekeeper golem linked to mausoleums, and to the process of burning death in ghost flame. So, given that lore, you'd think then that this is a man linked to the ancient processes of death, and indeed, he's actually physically very close to the darklight catacombs that brought you here, and catacombs traditionally do employ a lot of ghost flame processes in them. So that's kind of where the facts end on this guy, and where speculation begins. For example, Considering the armour, perhaps he was a defender of the local catacomb, who got swept up in or witnessed the Hornsent's purge. Or, considering the stitched hand that represents the heretics' desire for revenge, perhaps he now wishes to aid the frenzied of the forest. And do we think the blindfold could be related to frenzy? It certainly matches Hayeta's fashion, so there's something going on there, I think. Maybe blindfolds better enable one to envision the nothingness brought about by frenzy? Curious to hear what you guys think. Of course, none of this is fact, it's just my take on the guy. But of course, the real threat in the forest isn't the Madding Hand, it's the Winter Lanterns, the ageing untouchables, whose presence is heralded by the Winter Lantern Flies. These are winged insects, carrying a dangling grape. Upon seeing these, the wise know to stay well clear. Turn back, while you are yet able. Don't let it see you. Once you are seen, there is no escape. These messages are useful, but the most useful note of all is a page ripped from a diary and found in the manse. It reads, I touched him, but only once. When he thrust his staff in my face, I brushed it aside. It was then that I touched it, the ageing untouchable. Lore-wise, it's hard to know who wrote this note, but since it's a page ripped from a diary, you'd think then that this would have been written by a resident of the manse, who were known for their bookkeeping. What's more, this page is burned, just like all the other books, therefore this record was likely written before the Inquisition came through here. So it is that I think this ageing untouchable that the note writes about might have existed in the forest before the Inquisition arrived. The author of this note even sketched a picture of its likeness. To be clear, I'm only talking about one ageing untouchable here. The diary only mentions one of them, and so do the winter lanternflies, which are insects that herald the ageing untouchable's approach. On seeing these, it reads, the wise know to stay well clear. That's the best way to combat frenzy, right? To leave it alone. The quote unquote wise denizens of the Sanctum had likely learned this early on, and perhaps so too did Marika, who locked away the frenzied merchants underground, out of sight and out of mind. So in my headcanon, at least, Frenzy had appeared in the Sanctum before the Inquisition, and there was an ageing untouchable roaming that the manse had learned to steer well clear of. Of course, eventually more ageing untouchables would be created. There are six in game that you can find. But Frenzy had not yet gotten out of control. Remember, again, there's a phantom in the manse who wonders what crime Midra has even committed, and to be fair, is it a crime to learn painful truths? To despair? At any rate, while this note does reveal good lore, more than anything, it's meant to be a gameplay tip. It teaches you that by parrying a Winter Lantern's staff, the ageing untouchable can be killed. Upon doing so, most drop a swollen grape, an eyeball that has swollen over time. Marked with fingerprint burns, it is proof that the Winter Lanterns have been touched directly by the Three Fingers Embrace. These beings are the most dangerous thing in the Sanctum now, especially considering the Three Fingers seem to have blessed them directly. They're even wearing rags, which might suggest they've divested themselves of everything. But what defines them isn't that so much, it's something else. They are defined by their ageing. Parry this Winter Lantern, and you receive the Aged One's exultation, which reveals that their head is supposed to resemble this sprig of ripe grapes. This is fitting, but the most curious part is the quote that follows. Gift your madness to our lord, bless our brethren with grapes, take care that they fully ripen. This quote must have come from a hornscent, since it says our brethren. What's more, their walking sticks are twisted in a spiral, which is a hornscent symbol. So the ageing untouchables were once hornscent, and eventually there were many. And whatever they were, aged inquisitors or denizens of the Sanctum, now they exist to afflict the rest of the hornscent with frenzy. This frenzy is defined by its full ripening. Ripening is obviously something that happens with fruit, making it relevant in this situation where we're talking about grapes, which are eyes. And ripening is something that occurs over time. And so ageing, and enduring this madness is the key to this frenzy being powerful. And this frenzy is to be a gift, not unlike the Shabriri grapes we gift to Hayata, so that she might glimpse the distant light. Frenzy is shared like that, and theirs is to be a gift to their lord. Which brings us to Midra, finally, the old sage whose frenzy they surely intend to have fully ripen, so that he might become the lord of frenzied flame. This ripening has been enhanced by his torture, and the final words that he heard from his lady. Please endure, she said. It was a curse. Frenzy consumables tell us that the flame of frenzy burns the eyes, but tranquillity follows in its wake. No wonder Midra desperately wants to rip the torturous greatsword free of himself. For in the end, the lord of frenzied flame shall take their torment, despair, their affliction, every sin, every curse, all melted away. So reads the spell Midra's Flame of Frenzy, which is a remembrance incantation designed in praise of Midra, lord of frenzied flame. Curiously, this description ends with the line, yet Midra, like others before him, was too weak to become a lord. And yet, he did become a lord. So this line is kind of contradictory, right? Perhaps you're supposed to read this as, Midra was a lord of frenzied flame, but too weak to become a true lord since you defeated him. Or, alternatively, perhaps you're supposed to read it as if Midra was originally too weak to become a lord long ago. But over time, he did become strong enough to become one. Or rather, he endured long enough to become one. Enough. I have endured more than enough. I ask you forgive me, dearest Naniya. From this dialogue, we learn a few things. One is that Midra genuinely sees the madness as a curse, and is worried about what it could do to others. Thus, he warns you to stay away. Two is that he genuinely cares about his lady, who he calls dearest Naniya. And third, since Midra asks for Naniya's forgiveness when he succumbs to frenzy, I think Midra believes that Naniya told him to endure for the sake of others, yes, but also for her. So this maiden essentially wants Midra to suffer, in righteous hardship, for the one he loves. Now, where have we heard that before? If you are prepared to show resolve, and attain lordship through righteous hardship, then heed the words of I, Shabriri. Your flesh will serve love is kindling, and the girl can be spared, setting you on the righteous path of lordship.\" So let's discuss the idea, the theory that Naniya told Midra to endure specifically so that the frenzy could ripen within him, and then let's discuss the theory that she told him to do this because Naniya is Shabriri, a being who is chaos incarnate, put on this earth to ensure that chaos has its lord. In the base game, we learn that Shabriri is a sort of skinwalker, someone who has the ability to inhabit the bodies of others, in his case after they die, as he does with Yura, someone who is close to us. Thus, as the theory goes, perhaps Shabriri also came to inhabit Naniya's skin, to encourage Midra's endurance and bring about a lord in Midra's sanctum through what Shabriri calls righteous hardship. This wouldn't be the first time that Shabriri has attempted such a thing, it wouldn't even be the second. The player character is encouraged to embrace frenzy, to spare the life of their maiden, and so was Vyke, the tarnished who came close to becoming Elden Lord. We have an entire Prepare to Cry episode on Vyke's story that explains him and all the characters associated with frenzy, so check that out after this if you need a recap, but let me quickly read you one item description now that will succinctly explain Vyke's story. The fingerprint armour No other tarnished was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vyke, but without announcement, Vyke travelled far below the capital, and was scorched by the flame of frenzy. Did he make his choice for his maiden, or did some other force lure him with suggestion? Since Shabriri advocates for us becoming the lord of frenzied flame in the context of saving our maiden, burning in the Fel Flame, I'd argue that Shabriri did the same with Vyke, who would have been faced with the same choice. And with Midra being yet another potential lord of frenzied flame, who would also do anything for his maiden, we've established a pretty significant trend in how Shabriri might be using these three characters. In regards to Midra's character, specifically, the name Nanaya could be a reference to the Goddess of Love from Mesopotamian folklore. It's a name that carries connotations of sensuality and charm, things that would definitely help to explain why Midra might have been so enraptured by her. And as one last piece of evidence for the theory that Nanaya might be inhabited by Shabriri, take a look at the Shabriri's Woe talisman, which was made in Shabriri's Disturbing Likeness. It states the corners of his mouth are upturned in an almost flirtatious manner. And I find it so perfectly creepy that Nanaya has a similar smile to Shabriri in the portrait here. It's so good. I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I love this theory. I find it cool. And admittedly, the rule of cool might be affecting how strongly I advocate for this theory. So you should keep that in mind when listening to me. And on that note, I do want to say I first came across this theory in this Reddit thread. And it was through the process of agreeing and disagreeing with multiple arguments here that I came to my own conclusion. And my conclusion is that it's possible that Nanaya could be Shabriri. But it's also possible that Nanaya is just her own character, using a similar playbook as Shabriri. Either way, though, in my eyes, Nanaya is still a chilling, manipulative character who cursed Midra to endure very intentionally. But there are definitely a few ways to interpret Nanaya as a character. And I'd encourage you to come to your own conclusion on this as well. For example, another interpretation might be that instead of being literally Shabriri, Nanaya could instead parallel Hayeta, another sort of skin walker in the base game who seemingly unintentionally occupies Arena's flesh. In her story, Hayeta fulfills the role of finger maiden for you in the frenzy storyline, except she's the maiden to the three fingers, not the two. And maybe Nanaya was a sort of maiden to Midra, albeit a more manipulative one. And as another alternative interpretation, I guess you could argue that Nanaya isn't an advocate for frenzy at all. But I reckon it'd be hard to do personally. That's because the evidence of Nanaya being honest and really genuinely wanting Midra to endure for his own sake is kind of undone by the fact that when we find Nanaya's body in game, she's actually cradling someone who was a prior Lord of Frenzied Flame, albeit a feeble Lord of Frenzied Flame. Nanaya's torch is a torch made by attaching a dying Flame of Frenzy to a small spinal column. Now, this English description kind of makes it sound like it was a crafted item, with frenzy being attached to the spine. But the Japanese description makes no such claims, and indeed, the frenzy at the tip of the spine simply reflects, I think, one who was a past Lord of Frenzied Flame, since such Lords always have their spines culminate in a frenzied void. Anyway, the description goes on to read that, in a distant land, in an age long past, was born a man who failed to become the Lord of Frenzied Flame. All that remains of him is cradled gently by Nanaya. This description notes that the feeble Lord of Frenzied Flame existed in a distant land, and an age long past. Now, one interpretation of that is that the Realm of Shadow itself is that distant land in question, and that a Lord of Frenzied Flame rose here long ago, even before Midra. Alternatively, you might interpret the distant land as being distant from the lands between entirely, and that the feeble Lord's remains were carried here, maybe by Nanaya. It's kind of up to you. What is clear, though, is that there were other aspiring Lords of Frenzy before Midra, yet all of them were too weak. And surely for Nanaya to cradle this feeble Lord so tenderly suggests a connection between her and the Lord. Therefore, I feel like Nanaya has to have some malintent here with Midra, right? I mean, she's literally sitting in his chair, cradling a prior Lord's feeble remains. And since Midra is worried about the Frenzy spreading, I don't think he'd be too happy about her holding this torch. Not to mention, torches light the way ahead. So symbolically, she's having her path ahead lit by Frenzy. Now, I've seen some speculation that this spine belongs to Nanaya's child. The main arguments that I've read are that the spine is specifically defined as small, and that Nanaya cradles it affectionately. But just because Nanaya cradles something, doesn't mean it's definitively her child. To me, this just reveals that she has affection and perhaps pity for the subject. What's more, the spine being described as small, to me, is an indication that it belongs to a feeble Lord, not that it's literally a child's spine. Indeed, the spine is quite large, and is described as having belonged to a man. Okay, but could this have been her adult child then, who failed to become a Lord of Frenzied Flame long ago? And she could just be cradling their remains? And I mean, I guess you can't rule it out. But then some people insist that this was Midra's child, because Nanaya has her hand over her stomach in the portrait here, a pose that some believe suggests that she was pregnant at the time her portrait was taken. For this to be true, the child would have had to grow up in the Sanctum, and then succumb to Frenzy, and then fail to become a Lord. But that's a lot of history for the Sanctum to have had, so you'd think surely such history would have been mentioned in the lore, if it had happened. So while I think these theories are compelling, I don't subscribe to them, personally. I believe that Nanaya did have a history with a feeble Lord long ago. But to me, since she has such clear, sinister intent in telling Midra to endure, I'm not sure she can be this well-intentioned mother. And the idea of her being an advocate for the Frenzied Flame, and still giving birth, rubs me the wrong way as well. Because birth is kind of a sticking point for those who advocate for Frenzied Flame. In the base game, Hayata is euphoric at the idea of no more fracture and no more birth, so if you believe that Nanaya is aligned with Frenzy, then birth probably isn't too high on her agenda. So in the end, Nanaya's character continues to pose so many questions, like where was the distant land that her torch alludes to? What age long past featured this feeble Frenzied Lord? Nanaya wears spiralling clothing and hair in the style of the Hornscent, but is she their brethren, or is she pretending? Did she truly bring Frenzy to the manse? Did she slander the Sanctum and bring the Inquisition? Did she bring about the ageing untouchables, with the goal of creating a new, ripened lord? So many questions, and so much uncertainty, and yet, I'm sure the intriguing character of Nanaya will become an enduring mystery for the lore community for years to come. And that is always fun.

I have a store full of Displate art, and the newest print is this one, Skyward Swords by Anato Finstark. A print that was previously Patreon exclusive, so now it's available on Displate for the first time. Displate are these metal prints that use a magnet mounting system, and they're so easy to hang on a wall. The prints are excellent quality, and they've just been a steadfast sponsor of this channel, so if you're enjoying this video, please consider picking one up for yourself. And remember, if you buy 3, it's even cheaper. Regardless, thank you for listening, let's get back to the video. On the topic of Midra's endurance, one observation I was so happy to come across was this tweet by LilChurchLore, who comments on some assets extracted by Zlovsky2nd. These two accounts are great followers, by the way. Church notes that Midra wears a brooch adorned with green jewels, which in FromSoft games commonly means that it increases your stamina. So, they argue, for Midra, maybe these helped in fortifying his, quote unquote, endurance. In Elden Ring, specifically, the jewels are Viridian Amber, and the Viridian Amber medallion plus three actually is found very close by in the Darklight Catacombs, so the idea that Midra might have had access to this fortifying resource is a good little theory, for sure. Anyway, let's conclude. In the end, with you pushing him over the edge, Midra finally gives into that blissful salvation, his frenzy. But it's not enough, and his ripening was all for naught. But it's no matter, for as long as order remains, it seems, chaos cannot die. And there are other prospects, like Vyke, like you, tarnished, exposed to the injustices of the world, who might go on to become Lord of Frenzied Flame. For unlike Midra, you are bolstered by the great runes of the Elden Ring. You are unleashing frenzy from within the Ode Tree itself. Surely that has to count for something. Though, even then, this ending might not strictly be the end, for Melana believed in the beauty of the world that you burned down, despite its flaws. So, Melana, holding fast to Torrent's whistle, promises to deliver you a destined death. As Torrent burns away, his screams echoing in the distance, he was afraid for good reason.

      "[Doc 16: The Lore of Elden Ring is FOUL]\n",
      "Ages ago, before the Erd Tree, the Elden Lord Placidusax was challenged by Bael, a dragon that lacked the stone scales that made his kin immortal. So in mutual hatred, they fought, flesh against stone. Welcome to our second video on the Dragons of Elden Ring, which refines their stories with the extra content we now have from the Shadow of the Erd Tree. The DLC has revealed many truths regarding the drakes, dragon communion, and so much more. But what I want to start this video off with is the Crucible, because I think it actually has a lot to do with the story of Placidusax and Bael. So what is the Crucible? Well, the aspects of the Crucible describe it as a place where all life was once blended together, and Ordovus' greatsword says that it has a red tint that exemplifies the nature of primordial gold, which is said to be close in nature to life itself. This primordial matter, as it's called in the Gilded Greatshield description, would eventually go on to become the Erd Tree. But this always confused me, because if the Crucible existed at the beginning of life on this world, before the Elden Ring, then how could the Crucible have traces of gold? Shouldn't the gold have come from the Elden Ring, which we know arrived later? It didn't make sense to me, but now with the DLC, I think I understand. Count Ymir brings us the revelation that life itself was created in a cosmic rupture of the Greater Will long ago. We know that the Greater Will has gold as its aspect, and so it is that I think gold is just an innate part of the primordial matter of the world, even before the Elden Ring made landfall and put its roots into the Crucible, so to speak. All of this is to say that now I think the Ancient Dragons were some of the earliest beings born from this primordial soup. They embody many aspects of the Crucible, after all. Horn, tail, breath, wing, fang. So when Meta, Mother of Fingers, arrived on this world to scout things out, I think the Ancient Dragons might have been the earliest candidates for lordship. Then the Elden Ring was sent down, in the form of the Elden Beast, upon a golden star. And with that, I think these ancients of the Crucible were granted order. Remember, the Elden Beast is the living incarnation of the concept of order. And incidentally, the Elden Beast's internal name is Nebula Dragon, and it does somewhat resemble an Ancient Dragon. It even spews the same golden breath as Placidusax does. Of course, these things could be just coincidental, but what if they're not? What if the Elden Beast's form was chosen to help ensure that this vassal beast and the concept of order would be accepted by the Ancient Dragons? That's a fun thought, I think. Whatever the case, we learn from the Remembrance of the Dragon Lord that Placidusax was chosen as Elden Lord. But the question remains, who was his god who would be the vessel of the Elden Ring? Was it actually the Elden Beast? Or, more likely, I think, did he have a god equivalent to Marika, who chose him as Elden Lord in the first place? In the end, we just don't know. All we do know is that something went wrong with Placidusax's order, and his god eventually fled, with Placidusax endlessly awaiting their return. Whoever they were, it's possible that this god was also an Empyrean, a valid candidate for godhood. And like the other Empyreans we know of, it's possible that Placidusax's god was also an Empyrean chosen by the Fingers. And that idea makes me wonder if Meta, mother of Fingers, held any influence in this Dragon Age. The main reference to Fingers in this age comes from the Cincadéa, a five-fingered dagger wielded by the high-ranking clergymen of Foramazula who served the Dragons. The Cincadéa celebrates a beast's five fingers, which are symbolic of the intelligence granted upon their kind. Now, this description doesn't mention who or what granted the beasts intelligence, but in an older version of this description, it does. Back in version 1.0, it was said to be the Greater Will that granted the beasts intelligence. So this mention of the Greater Will was removed by From Software, and yet it does make sense that the Greater Will would bestow intelligence upon the beasts, considering Placidusax was Elden Lord at the time. So here's my theory on why it was removed. What if From Software removed this mention of the Greater Will because they wanted to keep the lore a little bit more open-ended? What if they wanted to leave room down the line for another character who might have been capable of bestowing intelligence on behalf of the Greater Will? This is just an idea, but what if it was Meta who granted intelligence to the beasts through Fingers? But however it happened, the beasts did gain intelligence, and a really great line on that topic comes to us from the description of Bestial Vitality, which reads, Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold. The way this last line is worded is strangely sad. I feel like it highlights that while something was being gained here thanks to the intelligence that was being bestowed upon them, a crucial part of the beasts' nature was being lost as well. Order had taken their wildness away. And just like with the aspects of the Crucible, such wildness and chaos would one day be looked back upon with scorn. But as we know from characters like Godfrey, the chains of order can be thrown off, and wildness can be embraced. Just so, aspects of the Crucible can persist, even if they are suppressed. For these horns, feathers, fangs, all, according to the DLC, are interminable evolutionary gifts and symbols of primacy, seemingly baked into the DNA of all life born from the Crucible. This is why I think that at certain points in history, the Crucible of Life would randomly throw a curveball into the mix, a wildcard that challenges the established order. In the Golden Age of the Ode Tree, it was the Omen, and the Misbegotten. And in the Golden Age of the Ancient Dragons, I'd like to propose that this curveball was Bael the Dread. There is something that I think is really interesting about Bael's heart. The first thing you'll probably notice about Bael's heart is that it's fleshy and biatrial, as opposed to the hearts of the Ancient Dragons, which are literally made of stone. This I think was a part of a genetic mutation, one that made Bael weaker in the sense that he was born mortal, without the stone scales of the Ancient Dragons that twist time and make them undying. But I think it also made him stronger in the sense that he was filled with a mad hunger, and a fierceness of spirit that you'd think could only come from one faced with the inevitable prospect of death. The other thing that's interesting about Bael's heart is that it's dotted with horn-like gravel stones. Gravel stones, as you may know, are the compound stones that make up the stone scales of the Ancient Dragons. And gravel stone is found within the hearts of all of the drakes. But what makes Bael's heart different is that the gravel stone in his heart is uniquely horn-like. And considering the significance of horns in the DLC, the fact they spell this out must suggest a connection to the Crucible, right? I feel like there's no way this description is a coincidence. The Beast Horn item from the DLC explains that the Crucible has a particularly strong influence on the beasts of the Realm of Shadow, causing many to grow horns despite the characteristics of their species. It was in this land that the vitality of the Crucible flourished, and so it is that I think Bael's biatrial heart, dotted with horn-like gravel stones and glistening with deep red liquor, was likely a mutation of the Crucible. Thus, Bael, father of the drakes, was born, as the first of the Ancient Dragon's lowborn descendants. These drakes are unique from the Ancient Dragons. Whereas the Ancient Dragons have four limbs, four wings, stone scales, red lightning, and two horns, the drakes have two hind legs, two wings, and a single horn. Most importantly, though, they don't have stone scales, making them mortal and paltry compared to their forebears. But if Bael was the father, then who was the mother? Well, it can only really be Grail, the Great Mother of Dragons, who might have been born in a similar way to Bael, or perhaps she's even the product of Bael mating with a different Ancient Dragon, and continued Bael's bloodline on her own. It's not completely clear. Whatever the case, as time went on, it seems Bael's descendants became lesser, not only compared to the Ancient Dragons, but compared to Bael himself as well. And I say this because Bael's later descendants are lacking a few of his key aspects. Take Bael's magma aspect, for instance. According to the Talisman of Dread, this aspect was so strong that when Bael roared, it would cause the Jagged Peak's molten fury to boil and churn. I love this design choice for Bael, because it's so poetic. Bael is born of the Ancient Dragons, who were made of rock, and what is magma but molten rock? Bael's fire is noted to be incredibly fierce, so if Bael had any stone scales, perhaps they were melted away? I believe this fierce fire is also a defining trait of Bael's kin as well. You'll note that every furnace column has a drake inside of its basket, and it's been speculated that these bodies might have played a part in fuelling these monstrosities. Speaking of Bael's fire, even Bael's red lightning is touched by flame. It's explicitly called Flame Lightning, and it's unique not only to him, but also to a few of the other drakes on the Jagged Peak. This is significant, because red lightning was a hallmark of the Ancient Dragons, and none of Bael's later descendants have mastered lightning at all. Specifically, the drakes that can summon Flame Lightning are the Jagged Peak drakes, encountered on your ascent up the mountain. These ones exclusively drop an item called Dragonscale Flesh, which marks them as aged dragons. Bael too is called an old dragon, so perhaps their older bloodline, being closer to the Ancient Dragons, explains this unique lightning that they've retained, something their descendants have lost over time. I want to note also that Dragonscale Flesh mentions these Jagged Peak drakes have inverted scales, which actually look a lot like gravel stones, so perhaps these drakes really are supposed to be closer to the Ancients in bloodline and nature, even if their models aren't any different than the other countless drakes in the game. Another interesting thing about Bael's Flame Lightning incantation, and his other Dragon Communion incantation, is that they both require pure arcane to cast, as opposed to something like Placidusax's Ruin, which is cast with pure faith. Placidusax having faith is easy enough to explain. Placidusax was Elden Lord to the Greater Will, and retains his faith even in his place beyond time after being abandoned, so of course his Remembrance incantation also requires faith to channel. As for Bael's arcane incantations, well, arcane is a little bit trickier to explain as a stat, but basically, arcane relates to one's innate qualities. The arcane weapons of Eokide, for example, can be swung through the air via the wielder's will alone, and the Albinaurics, born of Primordial Dew, are said to cast sorcery with their innate arcaneness. So when it comes to Bael, of course he would have incantations that require the highest arcane investment, because he's a character defined by his unwavering will and fury. But why? Why was Bael so furious? Well, one clue might come from the Hornsent Phantom in the Elder's Hovel, who implores Bael to hurry and lay it all to waste. To lay waste to the proud, the conceited, each, every last one of that arrogant lot. To be clear, this Elder Hornsent Phantom might be calling on Bael to lay Marika and her kin to waste, specifically, since they purged his kind. But I think there's a parallel being drawn between the Golden Order and the Ancient Dragon Order here. I think this Elder considers them all a part of the same arrogant lot. A defining trait of the Greater Will's orders across every age we know of, after all, is a pride among those in power, and their dismissal of those seen as lesser. In the Age of the Ode Tree, the lesser were those touched by the Crucible, the Tarnished, and many more besides. And in the Age of the Ancient Dragons, the lessers were the Beasts, who the Dragon Priestess actually insults as foul and lowly in the DLC. And then eventually, the Drakes too were considered foul and lowly, and the Ancients would go on to have intense hatred for them, as they considered them their lowborn kin. So yeah, I think there's a parallel between the Ancient Dragons Order and Marika's, and I think this is why the Elder Hornsent Phantom is calling on Bael to lay waste to all of it. Now, the Ancient Dragons might be excessively prideful in all of their depictions, but I do want to note that Bael was likely once on their side. Because as we've discussed with Marika, being called a traitor suggests that there was a kinship originally at some point. So Bael might have had a kinship with the Ancient Dragons as well. It might not have been a great kinship, but he must have been considered a part of their order, at least. But then the Ancient Dragons would label him a tyrant, and it all suggests that Bael went against the established order, and an established peace, harbinging destruction upon it all, as retribution for their conceit and discrimination, perhaps. I think, just like with Seath the Scaleless from Dark Souls, Bael sought revenge upon his prideful, immortal kin. There's a huge parallel between these two characters, but unlike Seath, who switched sides to find his advantage, Bael took a way more direct approach, and challenged the Dragon Lord himself. According to the Talisman of the Dread, Bael's challenge to the Ancient Dragon Lord ended in grievous mutual injury, which has forced his weight to now be supported by his tail, and he lost a talon, which now terminates in a sharp bone that's wreathed in lightning. As for Placidusax's wounds, his body is covered in scars and gashes, his tail has been cut, and most notably, three of his five heads have been severed, two of which are still clenched upon Bael's body to this day. The Dragon Priestess notes that after inflicting and suffering these grievous wounds, Bael made a hasty retreat, but the damage was done, clearly, and I reckon we could even speculate that perhaps Bael's assault even played a part in why Placidusax's god fled, or perhaps a part in why Placidusax decided to hide away safe in this place beyond time. This part of the timeline is still unclear to me, but I think Bael's tyranny... did do damage, whenever it was that it occurred. And after this, it inspired Placidusax to hatch a plan. For as he did with Bael, he saw in man a fierce spirit and insatiable hunger. The very things that, he thought, might one day fell Bael the Dread, and his drakes, who would become sacrifices all. In a time long past, Bael turned upon the Dragonlord. The foul traitor assailed our master and inflicted a grievous wound, only to make a hasty retreat, becoming a sworn enemy of the Brood. Since that day, Bael and his bloodline, the drakes, have served as sacrifices for Dragon Communion. This is Florisax, the Dragon Priestess, and here at the Grand Altar, she explains the origins of Dragon Communion. That there is a mad hunger and fierceness of spirit that only flows from those young and short of sight, and that after being wounded, Placidusax saw in mankind these qualities that could one day bring about Bael's doom. This hunger, unfathomable to the ancient dragons, would be weaponised. And so, the ancients tempted the drake warriors with the hearts of the drakes, who, with their lowborn kin, turned foe. To me, this is one of the most satisfying lore points of the DLC. Previously, we only knew that drake warriors were driven to consume dragon hearts and pursue the strength of dragons for the sake of the sublime beauty and awe that the dragons inspired. And that was reason enough, but it's such a great unexpected twist that Dragon Communion was founded to tempt drake warriors to consume the heart of Bael, in what the Dragon Priestess calls the purest form of communion, the fullest sating of hunger and consummation as a dragon whole. And speaking of Dragon Communion origins, from the Rock Heart, we learn that the first partakers of Dragon Communion were humans who actually consumed the rock hearts of ancient dragons, not the fleshy hearts of drakes. These rock hearts of the ancients were consumed in the ancient original form of Dragon Communion, turning the humans into a new form for the first time. So one thing I've been wondering is why the original form of Dragon Communion required this consumption of ancient dragon hearts specifically. Were these test subjects of sorts, or perhaps a showcase of what Drake Knights could aspire to? As far as I can tell, there are three stone hearts in game. One belongs to the ancient dragon man in the dragon pit, one, I assume, would belong to whoever left it behind upon the jagged peak, and the last belongs to the Dragon Priestess. According to her heart, the Priestess was once an ancient dragon herself, but sacrificed that form for feeble flesh to aid in the destruction of Bael the Dread. She assumed human form to share Dragon Communion with the world, and to this end, she attends the Grand Altar, bestowing the favour of the Dragon Lord upon the Drake Warriors who passed through here in that pursuit of Bael. The fact that Florisax attends a site of Dragon Communion makes me wonder if the two ancient dragons with rock hearts might have sacrificed their original forms in a similar way, giving up their hearts to take over the bodies of the first partakers of Dragon Communion. This is just speculation, but there is a dead ancient dragon at each of the two sites of Dragon Communion in the Lands Between, so what if these were the two ancient dragons who gave up their rock hearts? That's a fun theory, I think. The idea that these rock hearts were given up willingly is supported by the fact that we know the first partakers of Dragon Communion were loyal to the ancient dragons, and dedicated to their cause. For evidence of this, let's analyse the Ancient Dragon Man, starting with the Dragon Hunter's Katana that he drops. This katana is bristling with a spine of gravelstone, and has what is called a jagged gravelstone aura, which is akin to the aura that the Dragon Communion basins give off. Fittingly too, for this agent of the ancient dragons, his weapon, like all gravelstone weapons, has an anti-dragon effect. But his role wasn't solely to hunt the drakes. His katana reads, formerly a dragon communion warrior, the ancient dragon man was once arbiter of those worthy to devour Bael. That is, before you killed him and took his weapon for your own hunt. Incidentally, the ancient dragon man's death might be what allows Egon to progress in his quest. So this pleading from Egon could be directed at Bael, who does haunt him, and who is a dragon one should dread. But his begging for mercy could also be directed at the ancient dragon man, whose red phantom is just down the way, acting, as we mentioned, as a judge of those worthy to devour Bael, the dreaded one. But Egon, wounded as he is from a previous encounter with Bael, he's in no state to challenge the ancient dragon man, let alone Bael himself. Fittingly, it's been showcased by Zlovsky II that the ancient dragon man's human visage is draconian in origin, and as per the character creation screen, draconians have the stony face of the people of the ancient dragons. As mentioned in our previous video on dragons, there is evidence of humans being within the ancient dragon's culture upon Faramazula, so perhaps the man who consumed this dragon heart was once loyal to their order. Alternatively, if you're in the camp of those who believe that this face was never meant to be seen, you could opt to believe that the ancient dragon man was once from the land of reeds, given he wields a great katana. Dragon communion warriors are commonly from the land of reeds, you can look to Eura and Eleonora, or even the great katana looted near the ghost flame dragon in the graveside plains as more proof of that. But whoever the ancient dragon man was, now he occupies the dragon pit, which from the environment you can figure out is actually a bastion of those in service to the ancient dragons in the realm of shadow. And I say this because the lead up to the dragon pit features a tonne of ancient dragon statues, though they've all fallen into disrepair. Additionally, in the dragon pit itself, you'll find fire-breathing beastmen who we know were servants of the ancient dragons, and the basins here are filled with what I can only assume is the blood of drakes. This is a place that serves the process of dragon communion, and there's even a magma worm here, that resides. As you would have learned from our last video on the dragons, the magma worms were once dragon communion warriors. According to the Magma Breath incantation, those who have dined on the hearts of drakes will find their humanity slowly slipping away, and once they fully succumb to their fate, they are left no more than worms that crawl the earth. So when a drake warrior eats a drake heart, they inevitably, it seems, turn into magma worms. And I think we can finally understand why, by talking about what happens to us when we consume Bael's heart at the Grand Altar and harness his power. His incantations both read, even after being consumed, the throbbing heart of Bael continues to resist its subjugation, never weakening. One day, the fire within will consume the very body and soul of its communion devourer. One day. So could this never weakening resistance not also be true for the hearts of dragons that drake warriors consume? As mentioned by the Magma Breath incantation, it is the fate of those who partake in dragon communion to succumb and become a magma worm. Which I think finally makes sense, because Bael is a magma dragon, and the drakes are his kin, who have inherited his heat. Even before the DLC, the magma worm's scale sword was hinting to us that dragon communion is a grave transgression, for which the magma worms were cursed, cursed to crawl the earth upon their bellies as shadows of their former selves. And finally, with the DLC, dragon communion being called a curse makes sense. Once consumed, these drake hearts, still beating, are resisting their subjugation, just as Bael's heart describes, and they eventually overwhelm their devourer, turning their vessel not into a glorious dragon, but into an accursed landbound worm instead. So the sacrifice rituals that the drake warriors were performing in awe of the dragons were having dubious results. And yet, the warriors continued to indulge their appetites, all according to the dragon lord's plan. Such a grave transgression also retroactively helps to explain Exikis, who was the dragon communion revenger, who was so furious at the drake warriors that he did not forget his hatred, even as he succumbed to the scarlet rot. But how many drake warriors have there really been over the ages? Well, to understand that, let's read the description of the dragon's callabloom, which you'll find on your ascent of the jagged peak. This flower is dotted with gravelstone, and has an uncanny shape, coursing with hot blood. Its description reveals that a single flower is said to blossom only once, from the hearts of dead warriors who oft partook of dragon communion. So every time you loot this, you're actually plucking it from the bodies of dead dragon communion warriors, which is a fact that really helps to tell a story. This drake warrior likely died to this dragon. Six drake warriors died on their way up the peak, and this one got hit by the most telegraphed boulder of all time. What's more, callabloom might also actually help to explain what arteria leaves are, which are also found on human bodies, and are also coursing with blood. So I bet these grow from the hearts of dead warriors as well. But let me take my speculation on callabloom one step further. So callabloom's wide red leaves are essentially identical to the leaves on these plants, right? So I think that might mean that these plants might be callabloom as well. They just don't have the flower anymore, because the flower is said to blossom only once. And these plants blanket the earth in really appropriate places for the story. Here at the grand altar of dragon communion, for example, and here at the jagged peak summit, which is Bael's domain, where all the dragon communion warriors are coming to challenge him. So the fact that his arena might be carpeted in callabloom, and the fact that this arena does feature a ton of skeletons, is meant to convey, I think, that Bael has seen many challenges, and that all have failed to take him down. But what about the plants at the grand altar? Did a great battle take place here as well, between Drake and Drake warrior? Well, I think there's evidence that it did. As if the gargantuan dead Drake, with what looks like its heart missing from its chest, wasn't enough. Walk upon its wing, and you'll be able to loot dragon communion harpoons, which I can only assume you're pulling out of its flesh. These were tools of the old dragon communion warriors, the key word there being old, which, in addition to the harpoons sporting sharp gravel stone, might suggest these warriors had the ancient dragon's favour, back when the ancients were taking a direct hand in wiping out the drakes. As for what actually killed the gargantuan Drake, if you go behind it, you'll notice an enormous spike jutting out from the nape of its neck. And if you travel over the drake's head, you'll actually be able to get up there and get a closer look down at the thing. So through the centre of the object is this straight piece of what looks like metal, around which some sort of stone growth has formed. What's more, the metal has a blue green tinge to it. So what is this thing? My first impulse was just to call it a huge dragon communion harpoon. The metal rod down the centre might have simply corroded over time, and the smaller harpoons do actually have a bit of a green tint to them as well. And green rust is common to metals like copper and brass, after all. On that note, I've seen some speculation online that the green could indicate that the metal is verdigris, which according to the verdigris discus, is a corroded metal known for its heft. This is a great theory, and it really helps to tie the harpoons to crafting techniques that would have become unique to the realm of shadow. But to play devil's advocate, none of this really explains the rounded stone growths around the metal, which aren't sharp gravel stone like you'd think they should be on a harpoon. One theory I came across that's really cool is that this stone buildup might be fulgurite, which apparently is a sort of fossilised lightning that can occur from lightning strikes. Therefore, another theory is that this giant stake might be the remnant of a lightning strike, or perhaps more accurately, a dragon communion harpoon that has been imbued with lightning. I feel like that combines all of the theories together. Full credit to user eduty for dropping this geology knowledge on us. But for this giant drake to have been struck down by lightning, that would suggest that the ancient dragons were around to smite it down. So is there evidence of the ancient dragons being a part of this battle? Well, maybe. An item called sharp gravel stone is found nearby on the corpses of lesser drakes. The description reveals that this sharp gravel stone is actually the scale of an ancient dragon that has supped on the blood of lesser dragons, suggesting ancient dragons were here, I think, and that they were feasting upon the drakes. What's more, red fulgur bloom is found on the south coast of the jagged peak, and is said to bloom where the red lightning of the ancient dragons strikes the earth. This description seems to suggest this flower was, in fact, not set to bloom by the flame lightning that assails the peak, but rather by the red lightning of the ancient dragons. And this is probably a good time to mention that there are ancient dragons upon the jagged peak who are not hostile to Bael. So it might not have even been the hostile ancient dragons that generated the fulgur bloom or supped upon the drakes, it might have been friendly ones. This brings us to ancient dragon Senesax, who, among other ancients, is actually on Bael's side. And it's very interesting to note that these ancient dragons saw some merit in Bael's challenge to Placidusax. For them to switch sides, you'd think there really must have been some injustice in the Dragonlord's persecution of their lowborn kin. Either that, or perhaps these traitorous ancients simply believed that Bael was stronger than the Dragonlord. And maybe they believed that might makes right. It's impossible to know for sure. We learn about these traitorous ancient dragons from the hefty red lightning pot, which does this lightning AoE where it strikes, and reads, the ancient dragons who betrayed their lord to side with a tyrant were known for wielding branching red lightning. At first I thought that the branching red lightning would be this attack, but it can't be. These are actually called lightning stakes, and they're the hallmark of other dragons who definitely are not on Bael's side. Thus, I think the branching red lightning is instead this sort of chain lightning, that is characterised by its ability to branch out and chain between enemies. This is the same lightning that Senesax and the new lightning consumables generate. One fascinating thing that happens after you defeat Senesax is that, when you reload the area, the space Senesax occupied will instead be filled with a number of these slimes, imbued with red lightning. The implication being, I think, that Senesax's flesh has degraded into this form. Fun fact, in the DLC Early Access, these were accidentally silver tears imbued with red lightning, which they quickly corrected to these fleshier variants upon release. I think it's a significant change, because in the game's data, this variant of slime is called Wriggle Carian. Carian is explicitly defined as a dead animal's decaying flesh. You might not think the ancient dragons have flesh, but they do. They can bleed, they can be poisoned, they can rot, and they can die if they are severely wounded. So too, apparently, can they become undying carrion, imbued with red lightning. It's a bit weird that these are the only ancient dragons to turn into this sort of carrion. However, maybe it only happens to Senesax and her brood, because they wield that branching red lightning. Maybe that's how the carrion inherited this red lightning, at least. Anyway, I think FromSoftware implemented this carrion spawn, because they wanted to signpost other areas where ancient dragons like Senesax would have once stood upon the Jagged Peak. So now we know that where there's carrion, there was once an ancient dragon. And sure enough, wherever you find this red lightning infused carrion, you'll also commonly find ancient dragon smithing stones nearby, which are the scales of these beasts. Therefore, I think that in these places, ancient dragons died. But whether they were allied with Bael, and died to drake warriors, or whether they were allied with Placidusax, and died assaulting the Jagged Peak, I think is up to you to decide. In Egon's second encounter, he's somehow made it to the base of the peak, despite his injuries. I suppose that by defeating the ancient dragon man, in a way, you cleared the path for him that he could not conquer himself. Because of you, he can go down and out of the chasm, that requires a dragon communion warrior to be brave and show no fear. Drake warrior, dear friend, grant me this one wish. Take this finger, my finger, scale the Jagged Peak, face Bael the Dread, and when you do, summon me. Summon my soul. My limbs are limbs no more. My heart is twice overfilled with fear. But a drake warrior, I remain. And my soul yet lies on the mountain. With this, you bring Egon on your quest. Or rather, he brings you on his. Egon's bellbearing that you loot here can be used to craft Egon's harpoons, which can be fired from his bow, which is imbued with Egon's obsession. The harpoons read, The broken drake warrior Egon made these, one by one, in the midst of his agony, so that Bael the Dread himself would know fear. But I think Bael has already known fear, at the behest of a great enemy who he fled from after suffering his grievous wounds, which included the loss of a leg. It's the same as what happened to Egon. So, it's clear that Egon was designed as a parallel to Bael. Someone who is wounded, furious, terrified, but unbowed, defined by an unrelenting will. That will is present in Bael's descendants as well. We can look to the Ghostflame Dragon in the Realm of Shadow for proof of this. Ghostflame Breath reads, The land of spirit graves is home to all manner of dead, and even the corpses of fallen dragons found their way there. Several of them were endowed with such vivacity that, even in death, they could not fully die. Speaking of the Realm of Shadow, I wonder, has Marika's veil over this land had any effect upon Bael? When Bael challenged the Dragonlord, it would have been back when the Realm of Shadow was still a part of the Lands Between. And only then, long after Bael retreated to the Jagged Peak, would the Realm of Shadow have been split off from the rest of the world, becoming a land where death flows to, but not from. But perhaps this doesn't matter at all to Bael, because things between Bael and Placidusax are at a standstill. The Elder Phantom asks, O Bael, do your wounds yet ache, and has been waiting endlessly for Bael's fury to crest its zenith, but clearly, Bael has done little in this time. The only evidence we have of Bael striking against Placidusax at all, if you can call it that, is the presence of the drakes flying all around Faramazula. Given this new context of a mutual hatred between the drakes and the ancient dragons, I wonder, are these drakes flying around in some sort of suppression of Faramazula, or is their presence this environmental set-piece we were never supposed to look too far into? I'd love to know if anyone has any good speculation on this. Perhaps there's little these drakes, or Bael, can do to reach the dragon lord. Because Placidusax, as mentioned in our last video, has long dwelled in his seat at Faramazula, in his place beyond time, waiting for his god to return. So maybe he can't even be reached there, physically at least. May it grant you sleep, in your place beyond time. Somehow, the dragon priestess devotes her sleep to Placidusax, an act that likely makes his eternity of waiting easier to bear. And yet, he would abandon her in a mere instant, should she drink Teorlier's concoction and falter in her duty. An old dragon. No longer. Go on. Leave me be. Here, Florisax laments that she has fallen from grace, which I feel like might be wording that intentionally draws a parallel with losing the grace of the Golden Order. The dragons did once have the Elden Ring, after all, so it makes sense that the ancient dragons could have once had grace. But now, Florisax has lost Placidusax's grace, and she lost it just like that. I think this serves to prove just how painfully prideful the ancient dragons are. In following this questline, you'll earn Florisax's affection. The love of the ancient dragons has been documented previously with Vyke, and it's evident here too with the Dragonbolt of Florisax you receive. It reads, there was a time when the priestess never knew love, and thus never used this incantation herself. It's interesting to note that under Placidusax's reign, she did not experience love. But now, according to her spirit ashes, she not only has a human form, but now she has acquired a human heart as well, all thanks to her bond with you. Of course, this love is conditional on whether you can slay Bael or not. Before we show off Egon's fight with Bael, I want to take a moment to shout out Displate, who are the sponsor of this video. If you're looking for a dragon themed print, we actually do have one on there. It's called Guardian of Moonlight, and I reckon you'll have a fun time looking for all the references hidden within. But when you go to buy a print, keep an eye out now for the new Textra option, which is available on select prints in large size as well for the first time. Selecting this option gives a textured finish to your print, adding a depth that can really catch the light beautifully at certain angles. And with the link below, for a limited time, you can get 27% off if you buy one or two prints, and up to 33% off if you buy more than three. So let me know in the comments if you pick anything up. But back to the video. On your way up the Jagged Peak, you might have noticed the dried molten rock at the base. It's a reminder that the Jagged Peak was a volcano once, though it seems dormant for now. In the surrounds are countless dead drakes, many with that sharp gravel stone upon them that seems to indicate that they were victims of ancient dragons. But even though the description says that they've been supped on, a part of me also thinks they might have just been victim to each other. These dead drakes are surrounded by a Jagged Peak drake here, and further up two Jagged Peak drakes clash with each other. Such a thing reminds me of the description of the Hornstrewn excrement, which reads, It is said that the deadliest of the horned predators enjoy the sport of hunting and devouring other horned creatures. Their clash, I think, is this return to the wildness often seen in the days of the Crucible. In times long past, life was, after all, a crucible of competition. And one revelation from the newfound Bear Communion incantation is that only through desperate battle with the feral wild can one discover a god unique to oneself. So going back to what we said at the start of this video, I feel like there is a connection being made here to the Crucible, to the wildness that is so typical of it. A wildness that persists in the drakes, despite the order once granted upon their kin. At any rate, the biggest threat to Bael still isn't from his drakes, it's from you, and Egon. Once, Egon was nothing more than a poor scavenger of battlefields, but then he found honour through Dragon Communion. Egon's Dialogue From Egon's dialogue, we can note an interesting reveal, that the phantoms of others are embodiments of the soul. It's almost as if Egon's finger is furled in invitation. Invitation to fight alongside him, and fulfil the dream that he wasn't able to achieve in life. In phase two, Bael's fury finally crests its zenith, and he spontaneously generates wings of pure flame lightning, evoking the second set of wings that ancient dragons have. The second set of wings that he was born without. Now, the battle nears its end. Thank you for watching. Bael the Dread! You shall haunt me no longer! Bael the Dread! Before I go, special thanks as always to Mispap1 for just knocking it out of the park with the cinematography in this video, particularly the Bael and Egon sequences. Also, 6 or so of those shots were also thanks to Much118x, so special thanks to them as well for letting us use some of their cinematography in this video. They've been helping with the next Prepare to Cry as well, so look forward to that. And thank you again for watching.\n",

As they journey through the war-torn lands of Elden Ring, they will uncover the hidden truths of the world and confront the dark forces that seek to control it.\\n\\nBut beware, for the lore of Elden Ring is as twisted and convoluted as the roots of the great World Tree itself.
